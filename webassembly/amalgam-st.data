Etc/UTC# Contributing to the tz code and data

Please do not create issues or pull requests on GitHub, as the
proper procedure for proposing and distributing patches is via
email as described below.

The time zone database is by no means authoritative: governments
change timekeeping rules erratically and sometimes with little
warning, the data entries do not cover all of civil time before
1970, and undoubtedly errors remain in the code and data.  Feel
free to fill gaps or fix mistakes, and please email improvements
to <tz@iana.org> for use in the future.  In your email, please give
reliable sources that reviewers can check.

## Contributing technical changes

To email small changes, please run a POSIX shell command like
'diff -u old/europe new/europe >myfix.patch', and attach
'myfix.patch' to the email.

For more-elaborate or possibly controversial changes,
such as renaming, adding or removing zones, please read
"Theory and pragmatics of the tz code and data"
<https://www.iana.org/time-zones/repository/theory.html>.
It is also good to browse the mailing list archives
<https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/> for examples of patches that tend
to work well.  Additions to data should contain commentary citing
reliable sources as justification.  Citations should use "https:" URLs
if available.

For changes that fix sensitive security-related bugs, please see the
distribution's 'SECURITY' file.

Please submit changes against either the latest release
<https://www.iana.org/time-zones> or the main branch of the development
repository.  The latter is preferred.

## Sample Git workflow for developing contributions

If you use Git the following workflow may be helpful:

  * Copy the development repository.

        git clone https://github.com/eggert/tz.git
        cd tz

  * Get current with the main branch.

        git checkout main
        git pull

  * Switch to a new branch for the changes.  Choose a different
    branch name for each change set.

        git checkout -b mybranch

  * Sleuth by using 'git blame'.  For example, when fixing data for
    Africa/Sao_Tome, if the command 'git blame africa' outputs a line
    '2951fa3b (Paul Eggert 2018-01-08 09:03:13 -0800 1068) Zone
    Africa/Sao_Tome 0:26:56 - LMT 1884', commit 2951fa3b should
    provide some justification for the 'Zone Africa/Sao_Tome' line.

  * Edit source files.  Include commentary that justifies the
    changes by citing reliable sources.

  * Debug the changes, e.g.:

        make check
        make install
        ./zdump -v America/Los_Angeles

  * For each separable change, commit it in the new branch, e.g.:

        git add northamerica
        git commit

    See recent 'git log' output for the commit-message style.

  * Create patch files 0001-..., 0002-..., ...

        git format-patch main

  * After reviewing the patch files, send the patches to <tz@iana.org>
    for others to review.

        git send-email main

    For an archived example of such an email, see
    "[PROPOSED] Fix off-by-1 error for Jamaica and T&C before 1913"
    <https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-February/026122.html>.

  * Start anew by getting current with the main branch again
    (the second step above).

# If your system has a "GMT offset" field in its "struct tm"s
# (or if you decide to add such a field in your system's "time.h" file),
# add the name to a define such as
#	-DTM_GMTOFF=tm_gmtoff
# to the end of the "CFLAGS=" line.  If not defined, the code attempts to
# guess TM_GMTOFF from other macros; define NO_TM_GMTOFF to suppress this.
# Similarly, if your system has a "zone abbreviation" field, define
#	-DTM_ZONE=tm_zone
# and define NO_TM_ZONE to suppress any guessing.  Although these two fields
# not required by POSIX, a future version of POSIX is planned to require them
# and they are widely available on GNU/Linux and BSD systems.
#
# The next batch of options control support for external variables
# exported by tzcode.  In practice these variables are less useful
# than TM_GMTOFF and TM_ZONE.  However, most of them are standardized.
# #
# # To omit or support the external variable "tzname", add one of:
# #	-DHAVE_TZNAME=0 # do not support "tzname"
# #	-DHAVE_TZNAME=1 # support "tzname", which is defined by system library
# #	-DHAVE_TZNAME=2 # support and define "tzname"
# # to the "CFLAGS=" line.  "tzname" is required by POSIX 1988 and later.
# # If not defined, the code attempts to guess HAVE_TZNAME from other macros.
# # Warning: unless time_tz is also defined, HAVE_TZNAME=1 can cause
# # crashes when combined with some platforms' standard libraries,
# # presumably due to memory allocation issues.
# #
# # To omit or support the external variables "timezone" and "daylight", add
# #	-DUSG_COMPAT=0 # do not support
# #	-DUSG_COMPAT=1 # support, and variables are defined by system library
# #	-DUSG_COMPAT=2 # support and define variables
# # to the "CFLAGS=" line; "timezone" and "daylight" are inspired by
# # Unix Systems Group code and are required by POSIX 2008 (with XSI) and later.
# # If not defined, the code attempts to guess USG_COMPAT from other macros.
# #
# # To support the external variable "altzone", add
# #	-DALTZONE=0 # do not support
# #	-DALTZONE=1 # support "altzone", which is defined by system library
# #	-DALTZONE=2 # support and define "altzone"
# # to the end of the "CFLAGS=" line; although "altzone" appeared in
# # System V Release 3.1 it has not been standardized.
# # If not defined, the code attempts to guess ALTZONE from other macros.
#
# If you want functions that were inspired by early versions of X3J11's work,
# add
#	-DSTD_INSPIRED
# to the end of the "CFLAGS=" line.  This arranges for the following
# functions to be added to the time conversion library.
# "offtime" is like "gmtime" except that it accepts a second (long) argument
# that gives an offset to add to the time_t when converting it.
# "timelocal" is equivalent to "mktime".
# "timeoff" is like "timegm" except that it accepts a second (long) argument
# that gives an offset to use when converting to a time_t.
# "posix2time" and "time2posix" are described in an included manual page.
# X3J11's work does not describe any of these functions.
# These functions may well disappear in future releases of the time
# conversion package.
#
# If you don't want functions that were inspired by NetBSD, add
#	-DNETBSD_INSPIRED=0
# to the end of the "CFLAGS=" line.  Otherwise, the functions
# "localtime_rz", "mktime_z", "tzalloc", and "tzfree" are added to the
# time library, and if STD_INSPIRED is also defined to nonzero the functions
# "posix2time_z" and "time2posix_z" are added as well.
# The functions ending in "_z" (or "_rz") are like their unsuffixed
# (or suffixed-by-"_r") counterparts, except with an extra first
# argument of opaque type timezone_t that specifies the timezone.
# "tzalloc" allocates a timezone_t value, and "tzfree" frees it.
#
# If you want to allocate state structures in localtime, add
#	-DALL_STATE
# to the end of the "CFLAGS=" line.  Storage is obtained by calling malloc.

#	-DXPG4_1994_04_09
# to the end of the "CFLAGS=" line.  This causes "strftime" to always return

News for the tz database

Release 2023c - 2023-03-28 12:42:14 -0700

  Changes to past and future timestamps

    Model Lebanon's DST chaos by reverting data to tzdb 2023a.
    (Thanks to Rany Hany for the heads-up.)


Release 2023b - 2023-03-23 19:50:38 -0700

  Changes to future timestamps

    This year Lebanon springs forward April 20/21 not March 25/26.
    (Thanks to Saadallah Itani.)  [This was reverted in 2023c.]


Release 2023a - 2023-03-22 12:39:33 -0700

  Briefly:
    Egypt now uses DST again, from April through October.
    This year Morocco springs forward April 23, not April 30.
    Palestine delays the start of DST this year.
    Much of Greenland still uses DST from 2024 on.
    America/Yellowknife now links to America/Edmonton.
    tzselect can now use current time to help infer timezone.
    The code now defaults to C99 or later.
    Fix use of C23 attributes.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Starting in 2023, Egypt will observe DST from April's last Friday
    through October's last Thursday.  (Thanks to Ahmad ElDardiry.)
    Assume the transition times are 00:00 and 24:00, respectively.

    In 2023 Morocco's spring-forward transition after Ramadan
    will occur April 23, not April 30.  (Thanks to Milamber.)
    Adjust predictions for future years accordingly.  This affects
    predictions for 2023, 2031, 2038, and later years.

    This year Palestine will delay its spring forward from
    March 25 to April 29 due to Ramadan.  (Thanks to Heba Hamad.)
    Make guesses for future Ramadans too.

    Much of Greenland, represented by America/Nuuk, will continue to
    observe DST using European Union rules.  When combined with
    Greenland's decision not to change the clocks in fall 2023,
    America/Nuuk therefore changes from -03/-02 to -02/-01 effective
    2023-10-29 at 01:00 UTC.  (Thanks to Thomas M. Steenholdt.)
    This change from 2022g doesn't affect timestamps until 2024-03-30,
    and doesn't affect tm_isdst until 2023-03-25.

  Changes to past timestamps

    America/Yellowknife has changed from a Zone to a backward
    compatibility Link, as it no longer differs from America/Edmonton
    since 1970.  (Thanks to Almaz Mingaleev.)  This affects some
    pre-1948 timestamps.  The old data are now in 'backzone'.

  Changes to past time zone abbreviations

    When observing Moscow time, Europe/Kirov and Europe/Volgograd now
    use the abbreviations MSK/MSD instead of numeric abbreviations,
    for consistency with other timezones observing Moscow time.

  Changes to code

    You can now tell tzselect local time, to simplify later choices.
    Select the 'time' option in its first prompt.

    You can now compile with -DTZNAME_MAXIMUM=N to limit time zone
    abbreviations to N bytes (default 255).  The reference runtime
    library now rejects POSIX-style TZ strings that contain longer
    abbreviations, treating them as UTC.  Previously the limit was
    platform dependent and abbreviations were silently truncated to
    16 bytes even when the limit was greater than 16.

    The code by default is now designed for C99 or later.  To build in
    a C89 environment, compile with -DPORT_TO_C89.  To support C89
    callers of the tzcode library, compile with -DSUPPORT_C89.  The
    two new macros are transitional aids planned to be removed in a
    future version, when C99 or later will be required.

    The code now builds again on pre-C99 platforms, if you compile
    with -DPORT_TO_C89.  This fixes a bug introduced in 2022f.

    On C23-compatible platforms tzcode no longer uses syntax like
    'static [[noreturn]] void usage(void);'.  Instead, it uses
    '[[noreturn]] static void usage(void);' as strict C23 requires.
    (Problem reported by Houge Langley.)

    The code's functions now constrain their arguments with the C
    'restrict' keyword consistently with their documentation.
    This may allow future optimizations.

    zdump again builds standalone with ckdadd and without setenv,
    fixing a bug introduced in 2022g.  (Problem reported by panic.)

    leapseconds.awk can now process a leap seconds file that never
    expires; this might be useful if leap seconds are discontinued.

  Changes to commentary

    tz-link.html has a new section "Coordinating with governments and
    distributors".  (Thanks to Neil Fuller for some of the text.)

    To improve tzselect diagnostics, zone1970.tab's comments column is
    now limited to countries that have multiple timezones.

    Note that leap seconds are planned to be discontinued by 2035.


Release 2022g - 2022-11-29 08:58:31 -0800

  Briefly:
    The northern edge of Chihuahua changes to US timekeeping.
    Much of Greenland stops changing clocks after March 2023.
    Fix some pre-1996 timestamps in northern Canada.
    C89 is now deprecated; please use C99 or later.
    Portability fixes for AIX, libintl, MS-Windows, musl, z/OS
    In C code, use more C23 features if available.
    C23 timegm now supported by default
    Fixes for unlikely integer overflows

  Changes to future timestamps

    In the Mexican state of Chihuahua, the border strip near the US
    will change to agree with nearby US locations on 2022-11-30.
    The strip's western part, represented by Ciudad Juárez, switches
    from -06 all year to -07/-06 with US DST rules, like El Paso, TX.
    The eastern part, represented by Ojinaga, will observe US DST next
    year, like Presidio, TX.  (Thanks to Heitor David Pinto.)
    A new Zone America/Ciudad_Juarez splits from America/Ojinaga.

    Much of Greenland, represented by America/Nuuk, stops observing
    winter time after March 2023, so its daylight saving time becomes
    standard time.  (Thanks to Jonas Nyrup and Jürgen Appel.)

  Changes to past timestamps

    Changes for pre-1996 northern Canada (thanks to Chris Walton):

      Merge America/Iqaluit and America/Pangnirtung into the former,
      with a backward compatibility link for the latter name.
      There is no good evidence the two locations differ since 1970.
      This change affects pre-1996 America/Pangnirtung timestamps.

      Cambridge Bay, Inuvik, Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet, Resolute and
      Yellowknife did not observe DST in 1965, and did observe DST
      from 1972 through 1979.

      Whitehorse moved from -09 to -08 on 1966-02-27, not 1967-05-28.

    Colombia's 1993 fallback was 02-06 24:00, not 04-04 00:00.
    (Thanks to Alois Treindl.)

    Singapore's 1981-12-31 change was at 16:00 UTC (23:30 local time),
    not 24:00 local time.  (Thanks to Geoff Clare via Robert Elz.)

  Changes to code

    Although tzcode still works with C89, bugs found in recent routine
    maintenance indicate that bitrot has set in and that in practice
    C89 is no longer used to build tzcode.  As it is a maintenance
    burden, support for C89 is planned to be removed soon.  Instead,
    please use compilers compatible with C99, C11, C17, or C23.

    timegm, which tzcode implemented in 1989, will finally be
    standardized 34 years later as part of C23, so timegm is now
    supported even if STD_INSPIRED is not defined.

    Fix bug in zdump's tzalloc emulation on hosts that lack tm_zone.
    (Problem reported by Đoàn Trần Công Danh.)

    Fix bug in zic on hosts where malloc(0) yields NULL on success.
    (Problem reported by Tim McBrayer for AIX 6.1.)

    Fix zic configuration to avoid linkage failures on some platforms.
    (Problems reported by Gilmore Davidson and Igor Ivanov.)

    Work around MS-Windows nmake incompatibility with POSIX.
    (Problem reported by Manuela Friedrich.)

    Port mktime and strftime to debugging platforms where accessing
    uninitialized data has undefined behavior (strftime problem
    reported by Robert Elz).

    Check more carefully for unlikely integer overflows, preferring
    C23 <stdckdint.h> to overflow checking by hand, as the latter has
    had obscure bugs.

  Changes to build procedure

    New Makefile rule check_mild that skips checking whether Link
    lines are in the file 'backward'.  (Inspired by a suggestion from
    Stephen Colebourne.)


Release 2022f - 2022-10-28 18:04:57 -0700

  Briefly:
    Mexico will no longer observe DST except near the US border.
    Chihuahua moves to year-round -06 on 2022-10-30.
    Fiji no longer observes DST.
    Move links to 'backward'.
    In vanguard form, GMT is now a Zone and Etc/GMT a link.
    zic now supports links to links, and vanguard form uses this.
    Simplify four Ontario zones.
    Fix a Y2438 bug when reading TZif data.
    Enable 64-bit time_t on 32-bit glibc platforms.
    Omit large-file support when no longer needed.
    In C code, use some C23 features if available.
    Remove no-longer-needed workaround for Qt bug 53071.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Mexico will no longer observe DST after 2022, except for areas
    near the US border that continue to observe US DST rules.
    On 2022-10-30 at 02:00 the Mexican state of Chihuahua moves
    from -07 (-06 with DST) to year-round -06, thus not changing
    its clocks that day.  The new law states that Chihuahua
    near the US border no longer observes US DST.
    (Thanks to gera for the heads-up about Chihuahua.)

    Fiji will not observe DST in 2022/3.  (Thanks to Shalvin Narayan.)
    For now, assume DST is suspended indefinitely.

  Changes to data

    Move links to 'backward' to ease and simplify link maintenance.
    This affects generated data only if you use 'make BACKWARD='.

    GMT is now a Zone and Etc/GMT a link instead of vice versa,
    as GMT is needed for leap second support whereas Etc/GMT is not.
    However, this change exposes a bug in TZUpdater 2.3.2 so it is
    present only in vanguard form for now.

    Vanguard form now uses links to links, as zic now supports this.

  Changes to past timestamps

    Simplify four Ontario zones, as most of the post-1970 differences
    seem to have been imaginary.  (Problem reported by Chris Walton.)
    Move America/Nipigon, America/Rainy_River, and America/Thunder_Bay
    to 'backzone'; backward-compatibility links still work, albeit
    with some different timestamps before November 2005.

  Changes to code

    zic now supports links to links regardless of input line order.
    For example, if Australia/Sydney is a Zone, the lines
      Link Australia/Canberra Australia/ACT
      Link Australia/Sydney Australia/Canberra
    now work correctly, even though the shell commands
      ln Australia/Canberra Australia/ACT
      ln Australia/Sydney Australia/Canberra
    would fail because the first command attempts to use a link
    Australia/Canberra that does not exist until after the second
    command is executed.  Previously, zic had unspecified behavior if
    a Link line's target was another link, and zic often misbehaved if
    a Link line's target was a later Link line.

    Fix line number in zic's diagnostic for a link to a link.

    Fix a bug that caused localtime to mishandle timestamps starting
    in the year 2438 when reading data generated by 'zic -b fat' when
    distant-future DST transitions occur at times given in standard
    time or in UT, not the usual case of local time.  This occurs when
    the corresponding .zi Rule lines specify DST transitions with TO
    columns of 'max' and AT columns that end in 's' or 'u'.  The
    number 2438 comes from the 32-bit limit in the year 2038, plus the
    400-year Gregorian cycle.  (Problem reported by Bradley White.)

    On glibc 2.34 and later, which optionally supports 64-bit time_t
    on platforms like x86 where time_t was traditionally 32 bits,
    default time_t to 64 instead of 32 bits.  This lets functions like
    localtime support timestamps after the year 2038, and fixes
    year-2038 problems in zic when accessing files dated after 2038.
    To continue to limit time_t to 32 bits on these platforms, use
    "make CFLAGS='-D_TIME_BITS=32'".

    In C code, do not enable large-file support on platforms like AIX
    and macOS that no longer need it now that tzcode does not use
    off_t or related functions like 'stat'.  Large-file support is
    still enabled by default on GNU/Linux, as it is needed for 64-bit
    time_t support.

    In C code, prefer C23 keywords to pre-C23 macros for alignof,
    bool, false, and true.  Also, use the following C23 features if
    available: __has_include, unreachable.

    zic no longer works around Qt bug 53071, as the relevant Qt
    releases have been out of support since 2019.  This change affects
    only fat TZif files, as thin files never had the workaround.

    zdump no longer modifies the environ vector when compiled on
    platforms lacking tm_zone or when compiled with -DUSE_LTZ=0.
    This avoid undefined behavior on POSIX platforms.


Release 2022e - 2022-10-11 11:13:02 -0700

  Briefly:
    Jordan and Syria switch from +02/+03 with DST to year-round +03.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Jordan and Syria are abandoning the DST regime and are changing to
    permanent +03, so they will not fall back from +03 to +02 on
    2022-10-28.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen and Issam Al-Zuwairi.)

  Changes to past timestamps

    On 1922-01-01 Tijuana adopted standard time at 00:00, not 01:00.

  Changes to past time zone abbreviations and DST flags

    The temporary advancement of clocks in central Mexico in summer
    1931 is now treated as daylight saving time, instead of as two
    changes to standard time.


Release 2022d - 2022-09-23 12:02:57 -0700

  Briefly:
    Palestine transitions are now Saturdays at 02:00.
    Simplify three Ukraine zones into one.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Palestine now springs forward and falls back at 02:00 on the
    first Saturday on or after March 24 and October 24, respectively.
    This means 2022 falls back 10-29 at 02:00, not 10-28 at 01:00.
    (Thanks to Heba Hamad.)

  Changes to past timestamps

    Simplify three Ukraine zones to one, since the post-1970
    differences seem to have been imaginary.  Move Europe/Uzhgorod and
    Europe/Zaporozhye to 'backzone'; backward-compatibility links
    still work, albeit with different timestamps before October 1991.


Release 2022c - 2022-08-15 17:47:18 -0700

  Briefly:
    Work around awk bug in FreeBSD, macOS, etc.
    Improve tzselect on intercontinental Zones.

  Changes to code

    Work around a bug in onetrueawk that broke commands like
    'make traditional_tarballs' on FreeBSD, macOS, etc.
    (Problem reported by Deborah Goldsmith.)

    Add code to tzselect that uses experimental structured comments in
    zone1970.tab to clarify whether Zones like Africa/Abidjan and
    Europe/Istanbul cross continent or ocean boundaries.
    (Inspired by a problem reported by Peter Krefting.)

    Fix bug with 'zic -d /a/b/c' when /a is unwritable but the
    directory /a/b already exists.

    Remove zoneinfo2tdf.pl, as it was unused and triggered false
    malware alarms on some email servers.


Release 2022b - 2022-08-10 15:38:32 -0700

  Briefly:
    Chile's DST is delayed by a week in September 2022.
    Iran no longer observes DST after 2022.
    Rename Europe/Kiev to Europe/Kyiv.
    New zic -R option
    Vanguard form now uses %z.
    Finish moving duplicate-since-1970 zones to 'backzone'.
    New build option PACKRATLIST
    New tailored_tarballs target, replacing rearguard_tarballs

  Changes to future timestamps

    Chile's 2022 DST start is delayed from September 4 to September 11.
    (Thanks to Juan Correa.)

    Iran plans to stop observing DST permanently, after it falls back
    on 2022-09-21.  (Thanks to Ali Mirjamali.)

  Changes to past timestamps

    Finish moving to 'backzone' the location-based zones whose
    timestamps since 1970 are duplicates; adjust links accordingly.
    This change ordinarily affects only pre-1970 timestamps, and with
    the new PACKRATLIST option it does not affect any timestamps.
    In this round the affected zones are Antarctica/Vostok,
    Asia/Brunei, Asia/Kuala_Lumpur, Atlantic/Reykjavik,
    Europe/Amsterdam, Europe/Copenhagen, Europe/Luxembourg,
    Europe/Monaco, Europe/Oslo, Europe/Stockholm, Indian/Christmas,
    Indian/Cocos, Indian/Kerguelen, Indian/Mahe, Indian/Reunion,
    Pacific/Chuuk, Pacific/Funafuti, Pacific/Majuro, Pacific/Pohnpei,
    Pacific/Wake and Pacific/Wallis, and the affected links are
    Arctic/Longyearbyen, Atlantic/Jan_Mayen, Iceland, Pacific/Ponape,
    Pacific/Truk, and Pacific/Yap.

    From fall 1994 through fall 1995, Shanks wrote that Crimea's
    DST transitions were at 02:00 standard time, not at 00:00.
    (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)

    Iran adopted standard time in 1935, not 1946.  In 1977 it observed
    DST from 03-21 23:00 to 10-20 24:00; its 1978 transitions were on
    03-24 and 08-05, not 03-20 and 10-20; and its spring 1979
    transition was on 05-27, not 03-21.
    (Thanks to Roozbeh Pournader and Francis Santoni.)

    Chile's observance of -04 from 1946-08-29 through 1947-03-31 was
    considered DST, not standard time.  Santiago and environs had moved
    their clocks back to rejoin the rest of mainland Chile; put this
    change at the end of 1946-08-28.  (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)

    Some old, small clock transitions have been removed, as people at
    the time did not change their clocks.  This affects Asia/Hong_Kong
    in 1904, Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh in 1906, and Europe/Dublin in 1880.

  Changes to zone name

    Rename Europe/Kiev to Europe/Kyiv, as "Kyiv" is more common in
    English now.  Spelling of other names in Ukraine has not yet
    demonstrably changed in common English practice so for now these
    names retain old spellings, as in other countries (e.g.,
    Europe/Prague not "Praha", and Europe/Sofia not "Sofiya").

  Changes to code

    zic has a new option '-R @N' to output explicit transitions < N.
    (Need suggested by Almaz Mingaleev.)

    'zic -r @N' no longer outputs bad data when N < first transition.
    (Problem introduced in 2021d and reported by Peter Krefting.)

    zic now checks its input for NUL bytes and unterminated lines, and
    now supports input line lengths up to 2048 (not 512) bytes.

    gmtime and related code now use the abbreviation "UTC" not "GMT".
    POSIX is being revised to require this.

    When tzset and related functions set vestigial static variables
    like tzname, they now prefer specified timestamps to unspecified ones.
    (Problem reported by Almaz Mingaleev.)

    zic no longer complains "can't determine time zone abbreviation to
    use just after until time" when a transition to a new standard
    time occurs simultaneously with the first DST fallback transition.

  Changes to build procedure

    Source data in vanguard form now uses the %z notation, introduced
    in release 2015f.  For example, for America/Sao_Paulo vanguard
    form contains the zone continuation line "-3:00 Brazil %z", which
    is simpler and more reliable than the line "-3:00 Brazil -03/-02"
    used in main and rearguard forms.  The plan is for the main form
    to use %z eventually; in the meantime maintainers of zi parsers
    are encouraged to test the parsers on vanguard.zi.

    The Makefile has a new PACKRATLIST option to select a subset of
    'backzone'.  For example, 'make PACKRATDATA=backzone
    PACKRATLIST=zone.tab' now generates TZif files identical to those
    of the global-tz project.

    The Makefile has a new tailored_tarballs target for generating
    special-purpose tarballs.  It generalizes and replaces the
    rearguard_tarballs target and related targets and macros, which
    are now obsolescent.

    'make install' now defaults LOCALTIME to Factory not GMT,
    which means the default abbreviation is now "-00" not "GMT".

    Remove the posix_packrat target, marked obsolescent in 2016a.


Release 2022a - 2022-03-15 23:02:01 -0700

  Briefly:
    Palestine will spring forward on 2022-03-27, not -03-26.
    zdump -v now outputs better failure indications.
    Bug fixes for code that reads corrupted TZif data.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Palestine will spring forward on 2022-03-27, not 2022-03-26.
    (Thanks to Heba Hamad.)  Predict future transitions for first
    Sunday >= March 25.  Additionally, predict fallbacks to be the first
    Friday on or after October 23, not October's last Friday, to be more
    consistent with recent practice.  The first differing fallback
    prediction is on 2025-10-24, not 2025-10-31.

  Changes to past timestamps

    From 1992 through spring 1996, Ukraine's DST transitions were at
    02:00 standard time, not at 01:00 UTC.  (Thanks to Alois Treindl.)

    Chile's Santiago Mean Time and its LMT precursor have been adjusted
    eastward by 1 second to align with past and present law.

  Changes to commentary

    Add several references for Chile's 1946/1947 transitions, some of
    which only affected portions of the country.

  Changes to code

    Fix bug when mktime gets confused by truncated TZif files with
    unspecified local time.  (Problem reported by Almaz Mingaleev.)

    Fix bug when 32-bit time_t code reads malformed 64-bit TZif data.
    (Problem reported by Christos Zoulas.)

    When reading a version 2 or later TZif file, the TZif reader now
    validates the version 1 header and data block only enough to skip
    over them, as recommended by RFC 8536 section 4.  Also, the TZif
    reader no longer mistakenly attempts to parse a version 1 TZIf
    file header as a TZ string.

    zdump -v now outputs "(localtime failed)" and "(gmtime failed)"
    when local time and UT cannot be determined for a timestamp.

  Changes to build procedure

    Distribution tarballs now use standard POSIX.1-1988 ustar format
    instead of GNU format.  Although the formats are almost identical
    for these tarballs, ustar headers' magic fields contain "ustar"
    instead of "ustar ", and their version fields contain "00" instead
    of " ".  The two formats are planned to diverge more significantly
    for tzdb releases after 2242-03-16 12:56:31 UTC, when the ustar
    format becomes obsolete and the tarballs switch to pax format, an
    extension of ustar.  For details about these formats, please see
    "pax - portable archive interchange", IEEE Std 1003.1-2017,
    <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/pax.html#tag_20_92_13>.


Release 2021e - 2021-10-21 18:41:00 -0700

  Changes to future timestamps

    Palestine will fall back 10-29 (not 10-30) at 01:00.
    (Thanks to P Chan and Heba Hemad.)


Release 2021d - 2021-10-15 13:48:18 -0700

  Briefly:
    Fiji suspends DST for the 2021/2022 season.
    'zic -r' marks unspecified timestamps with "-00".

  Changes to future timestamps

    Fiji will suspend observance of DST for the 2021/2022 season.
    Assume for now that it will return next year.  (Thanks to Jashneel
    Kumar and P Chan.)

  Changes to code

    'zic -r' now uses "-00" time zone abbreviations for intervals
    with UT offsets that are unspecified due to -r truncation.
    This implements a change in draft Internet RFC 8536bis.


Release 2021c - 2021-10-01 14:21:49 -0700

  Briefly:
    Revert most 2021b changes to 'backward'.
    Fix 'zic -b fat' bug in pre-1970 32-bit data.
    Fix two Link line typos.
    Distribute SECURITY file.

    This release is intended as a bugfix release, to fix compatibility
    problems and typos reported since 2021b was released.

  Changes to Link directives

    Revert almost all of 2021b's changes to the 'backward' file,
    by moving Link directives back to where they were in 2021a.
    Although 'zic' doesn't care which source file contains a Link
    directive, some downstream uses ran into trouble with the move.
    (Problem reported by Stephen Colebourne for Joda-Time.)

    Fix typo that linked Atlantic/Jan_Mayen to the wrong location
    (problem reported by Chris Walton).

    Fix 'backzone' typo that linked America/Virgin to the wrong
    location (problem reported by Michael Deckers).

  Changes to code

    Fix a bug in 'zic -b fat' that caused old timestamps to be
    mishandled in 32-bit-only readers (problem reported by Daniel
    Fischer).

  Changes to documentation

    Distribute the SECURITY file (problem reported by Andreas Radke).


Release 2021b - 2021-09-24 16:23:00 -0700

  Briefly:
    Jordan now starts DST on February's last Thursday.
    Samoa no longer observes DST.
    Merge more location-based Zones whose timestamps agree since 1970.
    Move some backward-compatibility links to 'backward'.
    Rename Pacific/Enderbury to Pacific/Kanton.
    Correct many pre-1993 transitions in Malawi, Portugal, etc.
    zic now creates each output file or link atomically.
    zic -L no longer omits the POSIX TZ string in its output.
    zic fixes for truncation and leap second table expiration.
    zic now follows POSIX for TZ strings using all-year DST.
    Fix some localtime crashes and bugs in obscure cases.
    zdump -v now outputs more-useful boundary cases.
    tzfile.5 better matches a draft successor to RFC 8536.
    A new file SECURITY.

    This release is prompted by recent announcements by Jordan and Samoa.
    It incorporates many other changes that had accumulated since 2021a.
    However, it omits most proposed changes that merged all Zones
    agreeing since 1970, as concerns were raised about doing too many of
    these changes at once.  It does keeps some of these changes in the
    interest of making tzdb more equitable one step at a time; see
    "Merge more location-based Zones" below.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Jordan now starts DST on February's last Thursday.
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

    Samoa no longer observes DST.  (Thanks to Geoffrey D. Bennett.)

  Changes to zone name

    Rename Pacific/Enderbury to Pacific/Kanton.  When we added
    Enderbury in 1993, we did not know that it is uninhabited and that
    Kanton (population two dozen) is the only inhabited location in
    that timezone.  The old name is now a backward-compatibility link.

  Changes to past timestamps

    Correct many pre-1993 transitions, fixing entries originally
    derived from Shanks, Whitman, and Mundell.  The fixes include:
      - Barbados: standard time was introduced in 1911, not 1932; and
	DST was observed in 1942-1944
      - Cook Islands: In 1899 they switched from east to west of GMT,
	celebrating Christmas for two days.  They (and Niue) switched
	to standard time in 1952, not 1901.
      - Guyana: corrected LMT for Georgetown; the introduction of
	standard time in 1911, not 1915; and corrections to 1975 and
	1992 transitions
      - Kanton: uninhabited before 1937-08-31
      - Niue: only observed -11:20 from 1952 through 1964, then went to
        -11 instead of -11:30
      - Portugal: DST was observed in 1950
      - Tonga: corrected LMT; the introduction of standard time in 1945,
        not 1901; and corrections to the transition from +12:20 to +13
        in 1961, not 1941
    Additional fixes to entries in the 'backzone' file include:
      - Enderbury: inhabited only 1860/1885 and 1938-03-06/1942-02-09
      - The Gambia: 1933 and 1942 transitions
      - Malawi: several 1911 through 1925 transitions
      - Sierra Leone: several 1913 through 1941 transitions, and DST
	was NOT observed in 1957 through 1962
    (Thanks to P Chan, Michael Deckers, Alexander Krivenyshev and
    Alois Treindl.)

    Merge more location-based Zones whose timestamps agree since 1970,
    as pre-1970 timestamps are out of scope.  This is part of a
    process that has been ongoing since 2013.  This does not affect
    post-1970 timestamps, and timezone historians who build with 'make
    PACKRATDATA=backzone' should see no changes to pre-1970 timestamps.
    When merging, keep the most-populous location's data, and move
    data for other locations to 'backzone' with a backward
    link in 'backward'.  For example, move America/Creston data to
    'backzone' with a link in 'backward' from America/Phoenix because
    the two timezones' timestamps agree since 1970; this change
    affects some pre-1968 timestamps in America/Creston because
    Creston and Phoenix disagreed before 1968.  The affected Zones
    are Africa/Accra, America/Atikokan, America/Blanc-Sablon,
    America/Creston, America/Curacao, America/Nassau,
    America/Port_of_Spain, Antarctica/DumontDUrville, and
    Antarctica/Syowa.

  Changes to maintenance procedure

    The new file SECURITY covers how to report security-related bugs.

    Several backward-compatibility links have been moved to the
    'backward' file.  These links, which range from Africa/Addis_Ababa
    to Pacific/Saipan, are only for compatibility with now-obsolete
    guidelines suggesting an entry for every ISO 3166 code.
    The intercontinental convenience links Asia/Istanbul and
    Europe/Nicosia have also been moved to 'backward'.

  Changes to code

    zic now creates each output file or link atomically,
    possibly by creating a temporary file and then renaming it.
    This avoids races where a TZ setting would temporarily stop
    working while zic was installing a replacement file or link.

    zic -L no longer omits the POSIX TZ string in its output.
    Starting with 2020a, zic -L truncated its output according to the
    "Expires" directive or "#expires" comment in the leapseconds file.
    The resulting TZif files omitted daylight saving transitions after
    the leap second table expired, which led to far less accurate
    predictions of times after the expiry.  Although future timestamps
    cannot be converted accurately in the presence of leap seconds, it
    is more accurate to convert near-future timestamps with a few
    seconds error than with an hour error, so zic -L no longer
    truncates output in this way.

    Instead, when zic -L is given the "Expires" directive, it now
    outputs the expiration by appending a no-change entry to the leap
    second table.  Although this should work well with most TZif
    readers, it does not conform to Internet RFC 8536 and some pickier
    clients (including tzdb 2017c through 2021a) reject it, so
    "Expires" directives are currently disabled by default.  To enable
    them, set the EXPIRES_LINE Makefile variable.  If a TZif file uses
    this new feature it is marked with a new TZif version number 4,
    a format intended to be documented in a successor to RFC 8536.

    zic -L LEAPFILE -r @LO no longer generates an invalid TZif file
    that omits leap second information for the range LO..B when LO
    falls between two leap seconds A and B.  Instead, it generates a
    TZif version 4 file that represents the previously missing
    information.

    The TZif reader now allows the leap second table to begin with a
    correction other than -1 or +1, and to contain adjacent
    transitions with equal corrections.  This supports TZif version 4.

    The TZif reader now lets leap seconds occur less than 28 days
    apart.  This supports possible future TZif extensions.

    Fix bug that caused 'localtime' etc. to crash when TZ was
    set to a all-year DST string like "EST5EDT4,0/0,J365/25" that does
    not conform to POSIX but does conform to Internet RFC 8536.

    Fix another bug that caused 'localtime' etc. to crash when TZ was
    set to a POSIX-conforming but unusual TZ string like
    "EST5EDT4,0/0,J365/0", where almost all the year is DST.

    Fix yet another bug that caused 'localtime' etc. to mishandle slim
    TZif files containing leap seconds after the last explicit
    transition in the table, or when handling far-future timestamps
    in slim TZif files lacking leap seconds.

    Fix localtime misbehavior involving positive leap seconds.
    This change affects only behavior for "right" system time,
    which contains leap seconds, and only if the UT offset is
    not a multiple of 60 seconds when a positive leap second occurs.
    (No such timezone exists in tzdb, luckily.)  Without the fix,
    the timestamp was ambiguous during a positive leap second.
    With the fix, any seconds occurring after a positive leap second
    and within the same localtime minute are counted through 60, not
    through 59; their UT offset (tm_gmtoff) is the same as before.
    Here is how the fix affects timestamps in a timezone with UT
    offset +01:23:45 (5025 seconds) and with a positive leap second at
    1972-06-30 23:59:60 UTC (78796800):

	time_t    without the fix      with the fix
	78796800  1972-07-01 01:23:45  1972-07-01 01:23:45 (leap second)
	78796801  1972-07-01 01:23:45  1972-07-01 01:23:46
	...
	78796815  1972-07-01 01:23:59  1972-07-01 01:23:60
	78796816  1972-07-01 01:24:00  1972-07-01 01:24:00

    Fix an unlikely bug that caused 'localtime' etc. to misbehave if
    civil time changes a few seconds before time_t wraps around, when
    leap seconds are enabled.

    Fix bug in zic -r; in some cases, the dummy time type after the
    last time transition disagreed with the TZ string, contrary to
    Internet RFC 8563 section 3.3.

    Fix a bug with 'zic -r @X' when X is a negative leap second that
    has a nonnegative correction.  Without the fix, the output file
    was truncated so that X appeared to be a positive leap second.
    Fix a similar, even less likely bug when truncating at a positive
    leap second that has a nonpositive correction.

    zic -r now reports an error if given rolling leap seconds, as this
    usage has never generally worked and is evidently unused.

    zic now generates a POSIX-conforming TZ string for TZif files
    where all-year DST is predicted for the indefinite future.
    For example, for all-year Eastern Daylight Time, zic now generates
    "XXX3EDT4,0/0,J365/23" where it previously generated
    "EST5EDT,0/0,J365/25" or "".  (Thanks to Michael Deckers for
    noting the possibility of POSIX conformance.)

    zic.c no longer requires sys/wait.h (thanks to spazmodius for
    noting it wasn't needed).

    When reading slim TZif files, zdump no longer mishandles leap
    seconds on the rare platforms where time_t counts leap seconds,
    fixing a bug introduced in 2014g.

    zdump -v now outputs timestamps at boundaries of what localtime
    and gmtime can represent, instead of the less useful timestamps
    one day after the minimum and one day before the maximum.
    (Thanks to Arthur David Olson for prototype code, and to Manuela
    Friedrich for debugging help.)

    zdump's -c and -t options are now consistently inclusive for the
    lower time bound and exclusive for the upper.  Formerly they were
    inconsistent.  (Confusion noted by Martin Burnicki.)

  Changes to build procedure

    You can now compile with -DHAVE_MALLOC_ERRNO=0 to port to
    non-POSIX hosts where malloc doesn't set errno.
    (Problem reported by Jan Engelhardt.)

  Changes to documentation

    tzfile.5 better matches a draft successor to RFC 8536
    <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-murchison-rfc8536bis/01/>.


Release 2021a - 2021-01-24 10:54:57 -0800

  Changes to future timestamps

    South Sudan changes from +03 to +02 on 2021-02-01 at 00:00.
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)


Release 2020f - 2020-12-29 00:17:46 -0800

  Change to build procedure

    'make rearguard_tarballs' no longer generates a bad rearguard.zi,
    fixing a 2020e bug.  (Problem reported by Deborah Goldsmith.)


Release 2020e - 2020-12-22 15:14:34 -0800

  Briefly:
    Volgograd switches to Moscow time on 2020-12-27 at 02:00.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Volgograd changes time zone from +04 to +03 on 2020-12-27 at 02:00.
    (Thanks to Alexander Krivenyshev and Stepan Golosunov.)

  Changes to past timestamps

    Correct many pre-1986 transitions, fixing entries originally
    derived from Shanks.  The fixes include:
      - Australia: several 1917 through 1971 transitions
      - The Bahamas: several 1941 through 1945 transitions
      - Bermuda: several 1917 through 1956 transitions
      - Belize: several 1942 through 1968 transitions
      - Ghana: several 1915 through 1956 transitions
      - Israel and Palestine: several 1940 through 1985 transitions
      - Kenya and adjacent: several 1908 through 1960 transitions
      - Nigeria and adjacent: correcting LMT in Lagos, and several 1905
        through 1919 transitions
      - Seychelles: the introduction of standard time in 1907, not 1906
      - Vanuatu: DST in 1973-1974, and a corrected 1984 transition
    (Thanks to P Chan.)

    Because of the Australia change, Australia/Currie (King Island) is
    no longer needed, as it is identical to Australia/Hobart for all
    timestamps since 1970 and was therefore created by mistake.
    Australia/Currie has been moved to the 'backward' file and its
    corrected data moved to the 'backzone' file.

  Changes to past time zone abbreviations and DST flags

    To better match legislation in Turks and Caicos, the 2015 shift to
    year-round observance of -04 is now modeled as AST throughout before
    returning to Eastern Time with US DST in 2018, rather than as
    maintaining EDT until 2015-11-01.  (Thanks to P Chan.)

  Changes to documentation

    The zic man page now documents zic's coalescing of transitions
    when a zone falls back just before DST springs forward.


Release 2020d - 2020-10-21 11:24:13 -0700

  Briefly:
    Palestine ends DST earlier than predicted, on 2020-10-24.

  Changes to past and future timestamps

    Palestine ends DST on 2020-10-24 at 01:00, instead of 2020-10-31
    as previously predicted (thanks to Sharef Mustafa.)  Its
    2019-10-26 fall-back was at 00:00, not 01:00 (thanks to Steffen
    Thorsen.)  Its 2015-10-23 transition was at 01:00 not 00:00, and
    its spring 2020 transition was on March 28 at 00:00, not March 27
    (thanks to Pierre Cashon.)  This affects Asia/Gaza and
    Asia/Hebron.  Assume future spring and fall transitions will be on
    the Saturday preceding the last Sunday of March and October,
    respectively.


Release 2020c - 2020-10-16 11:15:53 -0700

  Briefly:
    Fiji starts DST later than usual, on 2020-12-20.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Fiji will start DST on 2020-12-20, instead of 2020-11-08 as
    previously predicted.  DST will still end on 2021-01-17.
    (Thanks to Raymond Kumar and Alan Mintz.)  Assume for now that
    the later-than-usual start date is a one-time departure from the
    recent pattern.

  Changes to build procedure

    Rearguard tarballs now contain an empty file pacificnew.
    Some older downstream software expects this file to exist.

Release 2020b - 2020-10-06 18:35:04 -0700

  Briefly:
    Revised predictions for Morocco's changes starting in 2023.
    Canada's Yukon changes to -07 on 2020-11-01, not 2020-03-08.
    Macquarie Island has stayed in sync with Tasmania since 2011.
    Casey, Antarctica is at +08 in winter and +11 in summer.
    zic no longer supports -y, nor the TYPE field of Rules.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Morocco's spring-forward after Ramadan is now predicted to occur
    no sooner than two days after Ramadan, instead of one day.
    (Thanks to Milamber.)  The first altered prediction is for 2023,
    now predicted to spring-forward on April 30 instead of April 23.

  Changes to past and future timestamps

   Casey Station, Antarctica has been using +08 in winter and +11 in
   summer since 2018.  The most recent transition from +08 to +11 was
   2020-10-04 00:01.  Also, Macquarie Island has been staying in
   sync with Tasmania since 2011.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Changes to past and future time zone abbreviations and DST flags

    Canada's Yukon, represented by America/Whitehorse and
    America/Dawson, changes its time zone rules from -08/-07 to
    permanent -07 on 2020-11-01, not on 2020-03-08 as 2020a had it.
    This change affects only the time zone abbreviation (MST vs PDT)
    and daylight saving flag for the period between the two dates.
    (Thanks to Andrew G. Smith.)

  Changes to past timestamps

    Correct several transitions for Hungary for 1918/1983.
    For example, the 1983-09-25 fall-back was at 01:00, not 03:00.
    (Thanks to Géza Nyáry.)  Also, the 1890 transition to standard
    time was on 11-01, not 10-01 (thanks to Michael Deckers).

    The 1891 French transition was on March 16, not March 15.  The
    1911-03-11 French transition was at midnight, not a minute later.
    Monaco's transitions were on 1892-06-01 and 1911-03-29, not
    1891-03-15 and 1911-03-11.  (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)

  Changes to code

    Support for zic's long-obsolete '-y YEARISTYPE' option has been
    removed and, with it, so has support for the TYPE field in Rule
    lines, which is now reserved for compatibility with earlier zic.
    These features were previously deprecated in release 2015f.
    (Thanks to Tim Parenti.)

    zic now defaults to '-b slim' instead of to '-b fat'.

    zic's new '-l -' and '-p -' options uninstall any existing
    localtime and posixrules files, respectively.

    The undocumented and ineffective tzsetwall function has been
    removed.

  Changes to build procedure

    The Makefile now defaults POSIXRULES to '-', so the posixrules
    feature (obsolete as of 2019b) is no longer installed by default.

  Changes to documentation and commentary

    The long-obsolete files pacificnew, systemv, and yearistype.sh have
    been removed from the distribution.  (Thanks to Tim Parenti.)


Release 2020a - 2020-04-23 16:03:47 -0700

  Briefly:
    Morocco springs forward on 2020-05-31, not 2020-05-24.
    Canada's Yukon advanced to -07 year-round on 2020-03-08.
    America/Nuuk renamed from America/Godthab.
    zic now supports expiration dates for leap second lists.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Morocco's second spring-forward transition in 2020 will be May 31,
    not May 24 as predicted earlier.  (Thanks to Semlali Naoufal.)
    Adjust future-year predictions to use the first Sunday after the
    day after Ramadan, not the first Sunday after Ramadan.

    Canada's Yukon, represented by America/Whitehorse and
    America/Dawson, advanced to -07 year-round, beginning with its
    spring-forward transition on 2020-03-08, and will not fall back on
    2020-11-01.  Although a government press release calls this
    "permanent Pacific Daylight Saving Time", we prefer MST for
    consistency with nearby Dawson Creek, Creston, and Fort Nelson.
    (Thanks to Tim Parenti.)

  Changes to past timestamps

    Shanghai observed DST in 1919.  (Thanks to Phake Nick.)

  Changes to timezone identifiers

    To reflect current usage in English better, America/Godthab has
    been renamed to America/Nuuk.  A backwards-compatibility link
    remains for the old name.

  Changes to code

    localtime.c no longer mishandles timestamps after the last
    transition in a TZif file with leap seconds and with daylight
    saving time transitions projected into the indefinite future.
    For example, with TZ='America/Los_Angeles' with leap seconds,
    zdump formerly reported a DST transition on 2038-03-14
    from 01:59:32.999... to 02:59:33 instead of the correct transition
    from 01:59:59.999... to 03:00:00.

    zic -L now supports an Expires line in the leapseconds file, and
    truncates the TZif output accordingly.  This propagates leap
    second expiration information into the TZif file, and avoids the
    abovementioned localtime.c bug as well as similar bugs present in
    many client implementations.  If no Expires line is present, zic
    -L instead truncates the TZif output based on the #expires comment
    present in leapseconds files distributed by tzdb 2018f and later;
    however, this usage is obsolescent.  For now, the distributed
    leapseconds file has an Expires line that is commented out, so
    that the file can be fed to older versions of zic which ignore the
    commented-out line.  Future tzdb distributions are planned to
    contain a leapseconds file with an Expires line.

    The configuration macros HAVE_TZNAME and USG_COMPAT should now be
    set to 1 if the system library supports the feature, and 2 if not.
    As before, these macros are nonzero if tzcode should support the
    feature, zero otherwise.

    The configuration macro ALTZONE now has the same values with the
    same meaning as HAVE_TZNAME and USG_COMPAT.

    The code's defense against CRLF in leap-seconds.list is now
    portable to POSIX awk.  (Problem reported by Deborah Goldsmith.)

    Although the undocumented tzsetwall function is not changed in
    this release, it is now deprecated in preparation for removal in
    future releases.  Due to POSIX requirements, tzsetwall has not
    worked for some time.  Any code that uses it should instead use
    tzalloc(NULL) or, if portability trumps thread-safety, should
    unset the TZ environment variable.

  Changes to commentary

    The Îles-de-la-Madeleine and the Listuguj reserve are noted as
    following America/Halifax, and comments about Yukon's "south" and
    "north" have been corrected to say "east" and "west".  (Thanks to
    Jeffery Nichols.)


Release 2019c - 2019-09-11 08:59:48 -0700

  Briefly:
    Fiji observes DST from 2019-11-10 to 2020-01-12.
    Norfolk Island starts observing Australian-style DST.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Fiji's next DST transitions will be 2019-11-10 and 2020-01-12
    instead of 2019-11-03 and 2020-01-19.  (Thanks to Raymond Kumar.)
    Adjust future guesses accordingly.

    Norfolk Island will observe Australian-style DST starting in
    spring 2019.  The first transition is on 2019-10-06.  (Thanks to
    Kyle Czech and Michael Deckers.)

  Changes to past timestamps

    Many corrections to time in Turkey from 1940 through 1985.
    (Thanks to Oya Vulaş via Alois Treindl, and to Kıvanç Yazan.)

    The Norfolk Island 1975-03-02 transition was at 02:00 standard
    time, not 02:00 DST.  (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)

    South Korea observed DST from 1948 through 1951.  Although this
    info was supposed to appear in release 2014j, a typo inadvertently
    suppressed the change.  (Thanks to Alois Treindl.)

    Detroit observed DST in 1967 and 1968 following the US DST rules,
    except that its 1967 DST began on June 14 at 00:01.  (Thanks to
    Alois Treindl for pointing out that the old data entries were
    probably wrong.)

    Fix several errors in pre-1970 transitions in Perry County, IN.
    (Thanks to Alois Treindl for pointing out the 1967/9 errors.)

    Edmonton did not observe DST in 1967 or 1969.  In 1946 Vancouver
    ended DST on 09-29 not 10-13, and Vienna ended DST on 10-07 not
    10-06.  In 1945 Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) switched from +01/+02
    to +02/+03 on 04-10 not 01-01, and its +02/+03 is abbreviated
    EET/EEST, not CET/CEST.  (Thanks to Alois Treindl.)  In 1946
    Königsberg switched to +03 on 04-07 not 01-01.

    In 1946 Louisville switched from CST to CDT on 04-28 at 00:01, not
    01-01 at 00:00.  (Thanks to Alois Treindl and Michael Deckers.)
    Also, it switched from CST to CDT on 1950-04-30, not 1947-04-27.

    The 1892-05-01 transition in Brussels was at 00:17:30, not at noon.
    (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)

  Changes to past time zone abbreviations and DST flags

    Hong Kong Winter Time, observed from 1941-10-01 to 1941-12-25,
    is now flagged as DST and is abbreviated HKWT not HKT.

  Changes to code

    leapseconds.awk now relies only on its input data, rather than
    also relying on its comments.  (Inspired by code from Dennis
    Ferguson and Chris Woodbury.)

    The code now defends against CRLFs in leap-seconds.list.
    (Thanks to Brian Inglis and Chris Woodbury.)

  Changes to documentation and commentary

    theory.html discusses leap seconds.  (Thanks to Steve Summit.)

    Nashville's newspapers dueled about the time of day in the 1950s.
    (Thanks to John Seigenthaler.)

    Liechtenstein observed Swiss DST in 1941/2.
    (Thanks to Alois Treindl.)


Release 2019b - 2019-07-01 00:09:53 -0700

  Briefly:
    Brazil no longer observes DST.
    'zic -b slim' outputs smaller TZif files; please try it out.
    Palestine's 2019 spring-forward transition was on 03-29, not 03-30.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Brazil has canceled DST and will stay on standard time indefinitely.
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen, Marcus Diniz, and Daniel Soares de
    Oliveira.)

    Predictions for Morocco now go through 2087 instead of 2037, to
    work around a problem on newlib when using TZif files output by
    zic 2019a or earlier.  (Problem reported by David Gauchard.)

  Changes to past and future timestamps

    Palestine's 2019 spring transition was 03-29 at 00:00, not 03-30
    at 01:00.  (Thanks to Sharef Mustafa and Even Scharning.)  Guess
    future transitions to be March's last Friday at 00:00.

  Changes to past timestamps

    Hong Kong's 1941-06-15 spring-forward transition was at 03:00, not
    03:30.  Its 1945 transition from JST to HKT was on 11-18 at 02:00,
    not 09-15 at 00:00.  In 1946 its spring-forward transition was on
    04-21 at 00:00, not the previous day at 03:30.  From 1946 through
    1952 its fall-back transitions occurred at 04:30, not at 03:30.
    In 1947 its fall-back transition was on 11-30, not 12-30.
    (Thanks to P Chan.)

  Changes to past time zone abbreviations

    Italy's 1866 transition to Rome Mean Time was on December 12, not
    September 22.  This affects only the time zone abbreviation for
    Europe/Rome between those dates.  (Thanks to Stephen Trainor and
    Luigi Rosa.)

  Changes affecting metadata only

    Add info about the Crimea situation in zone1970.tab and zone.tab.
    (Problem reported by Serhii Demediuk.)

  Changes to code

    zic's new -b option supports a way to control data bloat and to
    test for year-2038 bugs in software that reads TZif files.
    'zic -b fat' and 'zic -b slim' generate larger and smaller output;
    for example, changing from fat to slim shrinks the Europe/London
    file from 3648 to 1599 bytes, saving about 56%.  Fat and slim
    files represent the same set of timestamps and use the same TZif
    format as documented in tzfile(5) and in Internet RFC 8536.
    Fat format attempts to work around bugs or incompatibilities in
    older software, notably software that mishandles 64-bit TZif data
    or uses obsolete TZ strings like "EET-2EEST" that lack DST rules.
    Slim format is more efficient and does not work around 64-bit bugs
    or obsolete TZ strings.  Currently zic defaults to fat format
    unless you compile with -DZIC_BLOAT_DEFAULT=\"slim\"; this
    out-of-the-box default is intended to change in future releases
    as the buggy software often mishandles timestamps anyway.

    zic no longer treats a set of rules ending in 2037 specially.
    Previously, zic assumed that such a ruleset meant that future
    timestamps could not be predicted, and therefore omitted a
    POSIX-like TZ string in the TZif output.  The old behavior is no
    longer needed for current tzdata, and caused problems with newlib
    when used with older tzdata (reported by David Gauchard).

    zic no longer generates some artifact transitions.  For example,
    Europe/London no longer has a no-op transition in January 1996.

  Changes to build procedure

    tzdata.zi now assumes zic 2017c or later.  This shrinks tzdata.zi
    by a percent or so.

  Changes to documentation and commentary

    The Makefile now documents the POSIXRULES macro as being obsolete,
    and similarly, zic's -p POSIXRULES option is now documented as
    being obsolete.  Although the POSIXRULES feature still exists and
    works as before, in practice it is rarely used for its intended
    purpose, and it does not work either in the default reference
    implementation (for timestamps after 2037) or in common
    implementations such as GNU/Linux (for contemporary timestamps).
    Since POSIXRULES was designed primarily as a temporary transition
    facility for System V platforms that died off decades ago, it is
    being decommissioned rather than institutionalized.

    New info on Bonin Islands and Marcus (thanks to Wakaba and Phake Nick).


Release 2019a - 2019-03-25 22:01:33 -0700

  Briefly:
    Palestine "springs forward" on 2019-03-30 instead of 2019-03-23.
    Metlakatla "fell back" to rejoin Alaska Time on 2019-01-20 at 02:00.

  Changes to past and future timestamps

    Palestine will not start DST until 2019-03-30, instead of 2019-03-23 as
    previously predicted.  Adjust our prediction by guessing that spring
    transitions will be between 24 and 30 March, which matches recent practice
    since 2016.  (Thanks to Even Scharning and Tim Parenti.)

    Metlakatla ended its observance of Pacific standard time,
    rejoining Alaska Time, on 2019-01-20 at 02:00.  (Thanks to Ryan
    Stanley and Tim Parenti.)

  Changes to past timestamps

    Israel observed DST in 1980 (08-02/09-13) and 1984 (05-05/08-25).
    (Thanks to Alois Treindl and Isaac Starkman.)

  Changes to time zone abbreviations

    Etc/UCT is now a backward-compatibility link to Etc/UTC, instead
    of being a separate zone that generates the abbreviation "UCT",
    which nowadays is typically a typo.  (Problem reported by Isiah
    Meadows.)

  Changes to code

    zic now has an -r option to limit the time range of output data.
    For example, 'zic -r @1000000000' limits the output data to
    timestamps starting 1000000000 seconds after the Epoch.
    This helps shrink output size and can be useful for applications
    not needing the full timestamp history, such as TZDIST truncation;
    see Internet RFC 8536 section 5.1.  (Inspired by a feature request
    from Christopher Wong, helped along by bug reports from Wong and
    from Tim Parenti.)

  Changes to documentation

    Mention Internet RFC 8536 (February 2019), which documents TZif.

    tz-link.html now cites tzdata-meta
    <https://tzdata-meta.timtimeonline.com/>.


Release 2018i - 2018-12-30 11:05:43 -0800

  Briefly:
    São Tomé and Príncipe switches from +01 to +00 on 2019-01-01.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Due to a change in government, São Tomé and Príncipe switches back
    from +01 to +00 on 2019-01-01 at 02:00.  (Thanks to Vadim
    Nasardinov and Michael Deckers.)


Release 2018h - 2018-12-23 17:59:32 -0800

  Briefly:
    Qyzylorda, Kazakhstan moved from +06 to +05 on 2018-12-21.
    New zone Asia/Qostanay because Qostanay, Kazakhstan didn't move.
    Metlakatla, Alaska observes PST this winter only.
    Guess Morocco will continue to adjust clocks around Ramadan.
    Add predictions for Iran from 2038 through 2090.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Guess that Morocco will continue to fall back just before and
    spring forward just after Ramadan, the practice since 2012.
    (Thanks to Maamar Abdelkader.)  This means Morocco will observe
    negative DST during Ramadan in main and vanguard formats, and in
    rearguard format it stays in the +00 timezone and observes
    ordinary DST in all months other than Ramadan.  As before, extend
    this guesswork to the year 2037.  As a consequence, Morocco is
    scheduled to observe three DST transitions in some Gregorian years
    (e.g., 2033) due to the mismatch between the Gregorian and Islamic
    calendars.

    The table of exact transitions for Iranian DST has been extended.
    It formerly cut off before the year 2038 in a nod to 32-bit time_t.
    It now cuts off before 2091 as there is doubt about how the Persian
    calendar will treat 2091.  This change predicts DST transitions in
    2038-9, 2042-3, and 2046-7 to occur one day later than previously
    predicted.  As before, post-cutoff transitions are approximated.

  Changes to past and future timestamps

    Qyzylorda (aka Kyzylorda) oblast in Kazakhstan moved from +06 to
    +05 on 2018-12-21.  This is a zone split as Qostanay (aka
    Kostanay) did not switch, so create a zone Asia/Qostanay.

    Metlakatla moved from Alaska to Pacific standard time on 2018-11-04.
    It did not change clocks that day and remains on -08 this winter.
    (Thanks to Ryan Stanley.)  It will revert to the usual Alaska
    rules next spring, so this change affects only timestamps
    from 2018-11-04 through 2019-03-10.

  Change to past timestamps

    Kwajalein's 1993-08-20 transition from -12 to +12 was at 24:00,
    not 00:00.  I transcribed the time incorrectly from Shanks.
    (Thanks to Phake Nick.)

    Nauru's 1979 transition was on 02-10 at 02:00, not 05-01 at 00:00.
    (Thanks to Phake Nick.)

    Guam observed DST irregularly from 1959 through 1977.
    (Thanks to Phake Nick.)

    Hong Kong observed DST in 1941 starting 06-15 (not 04-01), then on
    10-01 changed standard time to +08:30 (not +08).  Its transition
    back to +08 after WWII was on 1945-09-15, not the previous day.
    Its 1904-10-30 change took effect at 01:00 +08 (not 00:00 LMT).
    (Thanks to Phake Nick, Steve Allen, and Joseph Myers.)  Also,
    its 1952 fallback was on 11-02 (not 10-25).

    This release contains many changes to timestamps before 1946 due
    to Japanese possession or occupation of Pacific/Chuuk,
    Pacific/Guam, Pacific/Kosrae, Pacific/Kwajalein, Pacific/Majuro,
    Pacific/Nauru, Pacific/Palau, and Pacific/Pohnpei.
    (Thanks to Phake Nick.)

    Assume that the Spanish East Indies was like the Philippines and
    observed American time until the end of 1844.  This affects
    Pacific/Chuuk, Pacific/Kosrae, Pacific/Palau, and Pacific/Pohnpei.

  Changes to past tm_isdst flags

    For the recent Morocco change, the tm_isdst flag should be 1 from
    2018-10-27 00:00 to 2018-10-28 03:00.  (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)
    Give a URL to the official decree.  (Thanks to Matt Johnson.)


Release 2018g - 2018-10-26 22:22:45 -0700

  Briefly:
    Morocco switches to permanent +01 on 2018-10-28.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Morocco switches from +00/+01 to permanent +01 effective 2018-10-28,
    so its clocks will not fall back as previously scheduled.
    (Thanks to Mohamed Essedik Najd and Brian Inglis.)

  Changes to code

    When generating TZif files with leap seconds, zic no longer uses a
    format that trips up older 32-bit clients, fixing a bug introduced
    in 2018f.  (Reported by Daniel Fischer.)  Also, the zic workaround
    for QTBUG-53071 now also works for TZif files with leap seconds.

    The translator to rearguard format now rewrites the line
    "Rule Japan 1948 1951 - Sep Sat>=8 25:00 0 S" to
    "Rule Japan 1948 1951 - Sep Sun>=9  1:00 0 S".
    This caters to zic before 2007 and to Oracle TZUpdater 2.2.0
    and earlier.  (Reported by Christos Zoulas.)

  Changes to past time zone abbreviations

    Change HDT to HWT/HPT for WWII-era abbreviations in Hawaii.
    This reverts to 2011h, as the abbreviation change in 2011i was
    likely inadvertent.

  Changes to documentation

    tzfile.5 has new sections on interoperability issues.


Release 2018f - 2018-10-18 00:14:18 -0700

  Briefly:
  Volgograd moves from +03 to +04 on 2018-10-28.
  Fiji ends DST 2019-01-13, not 2019-01-20.
  Most of Chile changes DST dates, effective 2019-04-06.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Volgograd moves from +03 to +04 on 2018-10-28 at 02:00.
    (Thanks to Alexander Fetisov and Stepan Golosunov.)

    Fiji ends DST 2019-01-13 instead of the 2019-01-20 previously
    predicted.  (Thanks to Raymond Kumar.)  Adjust future predictions
    accordingly.

    Most of Chile will end DST on the first Saturday in April at 24:00 mainland
    time, and resume DST on the first Saturday in September at 24:00 mainland
    time.  The changes are effective from 2019-04-06, and do not affect the
    Magallanes region modeled by America/Punta_Arenas.  (Thanks to Juan Correa
    and Tim Parenti.)  Adjust future predictions accordingly.

  Changes to past timestamps

    The 2018-05-05 North Korea 30-minute time zone change took place
    at 23:30 the previous day, not at 00:00 that day.

    China's 1988 spring-forward transition was on April 17, not
    April 10.  Its DST transitions in 1986/91 were at 02:00, not 00:00.
    (Thanks to P Chan.)

    Fix several issues for Macau before 1992.  Macau's pre-1904 LMT
    was off by 10 s.  Macau switched to +08 in 1904 not 1912, and
    temporarily switched to +09/+10 during World War II.  Macau
    observed DST in 1942/79, not 1961/80, and there were several
    errors for transition times and dates.  (Thanks to P Chan.)

    The 1948-1951 fallback transitions in Japan were at 25:00 on
    September's second Saturday, not at 24:00.  (Thanks to Phake Nick.)
    zic turns this into 01:00 on the day after September's second
    Saturday, which is the best that POSIX or C platforms can do.

    Incorporate 1940-1949 Asia/Shanghai DST transitions from a 2014
    paper by Li Yu, replacing more-questionable data from Shanks.

  Changes to time zone abbreviations

    Use "PST" and "PDT" for Philippine time.  (Thanks to Paul Goyette.)

  Changes to code

    zic now always generates TZif files where time type 0 is used for
    timestamps before the first transition.  This simplifies the
    reading of TZif files and should not affect behavior of existing
    TZif readers because the same set of time types is used; only
    their internal indexes may have changed.  This affects only the
    legacy zones EST5EDT, CST6CDT, MST7MDT, PST8PDT, CET, MET, and
    EET, which previously used nonzero types for these timestamps.

    Because of the type 0 change, zic no longer outputs a dummy
    transition at time -2**59 (before the Big Bang), as clients should
    no longer need this to handle historical timestamps correctly.
    This reverts a change introduced in 2013d and shrinks most TZif
    files by a few bytes.

    zic now supports negative time-of-day in Rule and Leap lines, e.g.,
    "Rule X min max - Apr lastSun -6:00 1:00 -" means the transition
    occurs at 18:00 on the Saturday before the last Sunday in April.
    This behavior was documented in 2018a but the code did not
    entirely match the documentation.

    localtime.c no longer requires at least one time type in TZif
    files that lack transitions or have a POSIX-style TZ string.  This
    future-proofs the code against possible future extensions to the
    format that would allow TZif files with POSIX-style TZ strings and
    without transitions or time types.

    A read-access subscript error in localtime.c has been fixed.
    It could occur only in TZif files with timecnt == 0, something that
    does not happen in practice now but could happen in future versions.

    localtime.c no longer ignores TZif POSIX-style TZ strings that
    specify only standard time.  Instead, these TZ strings now
    override the default time type for timestamps after the last
    transition (or for all timestamps if there are no transitions),
    just as DST strings specifying DST have always done.

    leapseconds.awk now outputs "#updated" and "#expires" comments,
    and supports leap seconds at the ends of months other than June
    and December.  (Inspired by suggestions from Chris Woodbury.)

  Changes to documentation

    New restrictions: A Rule name must start with a character that
    is neither an ASCII digit nor "-" nor "+", and an unquoted name
    should not use characters in the set "!$%&'()*,/:;<=>?@[\]^`{|}~".
    The latter restriction makes room for future extensions (a
    possibility noted by Tom Lane).

    tzfile.5 now documents what time types apply before the first and
    after the last transition, if any.

    Documentation now uses the spelling "timezone" for a TZ setting
    that determines timestamp history, and "time zone" for a
    geographic region currently sharing the same standard time.

    The name "TZif" is now used for the tz binary data format.

    tz-link.htm now mentions the A0 TimeZone Migration utilities.
    (Thanks to Aldrin Martoq for the link.)

  Changes to build procedure

    New 'make' target 'rearguard_tarballs' to build the rearguard
    tarball only.  This is a convenience on platforms that lack lzip
    if you want to build the rearguard tarball.  (Problem reported by
    Deborah Goldsmith.)

    tzdata.zi is now more stable from release to release.  (Problem
    noted by Tom Lane.)  It is also a bit shorter.

    tzdata.zi now can contain comment lines documenting configuration
    information, such as which data format was selected, which input
    files were used, and how leap seconds are treated.  (Problems
    noted by Lester Caine and Brian Inglis.)  If the Makefile defaults
    are used these comment lines are absent, for backward
    compatibility.  A redistributor intending to alter its copy of the
    files should also append "-LABEL" to the 'version' file's first
    line, where "LABEL" identifies the redistributor's change.


Release 2018e - 2018-05-01 23:42:51 -0700

  Briefly:

    North Korea switches back to +09 on 2018-05-05.
    The main format uses negative DST again, for Ireland etc.
    'make tarballs' now also builds a rearguard tarball.
    New 's' and 'd' suffixes in SAVE columns of Rule and Zone lines.

  Changes to past and future timestamps

    North Korea switches back from +0830 to +09 on 2018-05-05.
    (Thanks to Kang Seonghoon, Arthur David Olson, Seo Sanghyeon,
    and Tim Parenti.)

    Bring back the negative-DST changes of 2018a, except be more
    compatible with data parsers that do not support negative DST.
    Also, this now affects historical timestamps in Namibia and the
    former Czechoslovakia, not just Ireland.  The main format now uses
    negative DST to model timestamps in Europe/Dublin (from 1971 on),
    Europe/Prague (1946/7), and Africa/Windhoek (1994/2017).  This
    does not affect UT offsets, only time zone abbreviations and the
    tm_isdst flag.  Also, this does not affect rearguard or vanguard
    formats; effectively the main format now uses vanguard instead of
    rearguard format.  Data parsers that do not support negative DST
    can still use data from the rearguard tarball described below.

  Changes to build procedure

    The command 'make tarballs' now also builds the tarball
    tzdataVERSION-rearguard.tar.gz, which is like tzdataVERSION.tar.gz
    except that it uses rearguard format intended for trailing-edge
    data parsers.

  Changes to data format and to code

    The SAVE column of Rule and Zone lines can now have an 's' or 'd'
    suffix, which specifies whether the adjusted time is standard time
    or daylight saving time.  If no suffix is given, daylight saving
    time is used if and only if the SAVE column is nonzero; this is
    the longstanding behavior.  Although this new feature is not used
    in tzdata, it could be used to specify the legal time in Namibia
    1994-2017, as opposed to the popular time (see below).

  Changes to past timestamps

    From 1994 through 2017 Namibia observed DST in winter, not summer.
    That is, it used negative DST, as Ireland still does.  This change
    does not affect UTC offsets; it affects only the tm_isdst flag and
    the abbreviation used during summer, which is now CAT, not WAST.
    Although (as noted by Michael Deckers) summer and winter time were
    both simply called "standard time" in Namibian law, in common
    practice winter time was considered to be DST (as noted by Stephen
    Colebourne).  The full effect of this change is only in vanguard
    and main format; in rearguard format, the tm_isdst flag is still
    zero in winter and nonzero in summer.

    In 1946/7 Czechoslovakia also observed negative DST in winter.
    The full effect of this change is only in vanguard and main
    formats; in rearguard format, it is modeled as plain GMT without
    daylight saving.  Also, the dates of some 1944/5 DST transitions
    in Czechoslovakia have been changed.


Release 2018d - 2018-03-22 07:05:46 -0700

  Briefly:

  Palestine starts DST a week earlier in 2018.
  Add support for vanguard and rearguard data consumers.
  Add subsecond precision to source data format, though not to data.

  Changes to future timestamps

    In 2018, Palestine starts DST on March 24, not March 31.
    Adjust future predictions accordingly.  (Thanks to Sharef Mustafa.)

  Changes to past and future timestamps

    Casey Station in Antarctica changed from +11 to +08 on 2018-03-11
    at 04:00.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Changes to past timestamps

    Historical transitions for Uruguay, represented by
    America/Montevideo, have been updated per official legal documents,
    replacing previous data mainly originating from the inventions of
    Shanks & Pottenger.  This has resulted in adjustments ranging from
    30 to 90 minutes in either direction over at least two dozen
    distinct periods ranging from one day to several years in length.
    A mere handful of pre-1991 transitions are unaffected; data since
    then has come from more reliable contemporaneous reporting.  These
    changes affect various timestamps in 1920-1923, 1936, 1939,
    1942-1943, 1959, 1966-1970, 1972, 1974-1980, and 1988-1990.
    Additionally, Uruguay's pre-standard-time UT offset has been
    adjusted westward by 7 seconds, from UT-03:44:44 to UT-03:44:51, to
    match the location of the Observatory of the National Meteorological
    Institute in Montevideo.
    (Thanks to Jeremie Bonjour, Tim Parenti, and Michael Deckers.)

    East Kiribati skipped New Year's Eve 1994, not New Year's Day 1995.
    (Thanks to Kerry Shetline.)

    Fix the 1912-01-01 transition for Portugal and its colonies.
    This transition was at 00:00 according to the new UT offset, not
    according to the old one.  Also assume that Cape Verde switched on
    the same date as the rest, not in 1907.  This affects
    Africa/Bissau, Africa/Sao_Tome, Asia/Macau, Atlantic/Azores,
    Atlantic/Cape_Verde, Atlantic/Madeira, and Europe/Lisbon.
    (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)

    Fix an off-by-1 error for pre-1913 timestamps in Jamaica and in
    Turks & Caicos.

  Changes to past time zone abbreviations

    MMT took effect in Uruguay from 1908-06-10, not 1898-06-28.  There
    is no clock change associated with the transition.

  Changes to build procedure

    The new DATAFORM macro in the Makefile lets the installer choose
    among three source data formats.  The idea is to lessen downstream
    disruption when data formats are improved.

    * DATAFORM=vanguard installs from the latest, bleeding-edge
      format.  DATAFORM=main (the default) installs from the format
      used in the 'africa' etc. files.  DATAFORM=rearguard installs
      from a trailing-edge format.  Eventually, elements of today's
      vanguard format should move to the main format, and similarly
      the main format's features should eventually move to the
      rearguard format.

    * In the current version, the main and rearguard formats are
      identical and match that of 2018c, so this change does not
      affect default behavior.  The vanguard format currently contains
      one feature not in the main format: negative SAVE values.  This
      improves support for Ireland, which uses Irish Standard Time
      (IST, UTC+01) in summer and GMT (UTC) in winter.  tzcode has
      supported negative SAVE values for decades, and this feature
      should move to the main format soon.  However, it will not move
      to the rearguard format for quite some time because some
      downstream parsers do not support it.

    * The build procedure constructs three files vanguard.zi, main.zi,
      and rearguard.zi, one for each format.  Although the files
      represent essentially the same data, they may have minor
      discrepancies that users are not likely to notice.  The files
      are intended for downstream data consumers and are not
      installed.  Zoneinfo parsers that do not support negative SAVE values
      should start using rearguard.zi, so that they will be unaffected
      when the negative-DST feature moves from vanguard to main.
      Bleeding-edge Zoneinfo parsers that support the new features
      already can use vanguard.zi; in this respect, current tzcode is
      bleeding-edge.

    The Makefile should now be safe for parallelized builds, and 'make
    -j to2050new.tzs' is now much faster on a multiprocessor host
    with GNU Make.

    When built with -DSUPPRESS_TZDIR, the tzcode library no longer
    prepends TZDIR/ to file names that do not begin with '/'.  This is
    not recommended for general use, due to its security implications.
    (From a suggestion by Manuela Friedrich.)

  Changes to code

    zic now accepts subsecond precision in expressions like
    00:19:32.13, which is approximately the legal time of the
    Netherlands from 1835 to 1937.  However, because it is
    questionable whether the few recorded uses of non-integer offsets
    had subsecond precision in practice, there are no plans for tzdata
    to use this feature.  (Thanks to Steve Allen for pointing out
    the limitations of historical data in this area.)

    The code is a bit more portable to MS-Windows.  Installers can
    compile with -DRESERVE_STD_EXT_IDS on MS-Windows platforms that
    reserve identifiers like 'localtime'.  (Thanks to Manuela
    Friedrich.)

  Changes to documentation and commentary

    theory.html now outlines tzdb's extensions to POSIX's model for
    civil time, and has a section "POSIX features no longer needed"
    that lists POSIX API components that are now vestigial.
    (From suggestions by Steve Summit.)  It also better distinguishes
    time zones from tz regions.  (From a suggestion by Guy Harris.)

    Commentary is now more consistent about using the phrase "daylight
    saving time", to match the C name tm_isdst.  Daylight saving time
    need not occur in summer, and need not have a positive offset from
    standard time.

    Commentary about historical transitions in Uruguay has been expanded
    with links to many relevant legal documents.
    (Thanks to Tim Parenti.)

    Commentary now uses some non-ASCII characters with Unicode value
    less than U+0100, as they can be useful and should work even with
    older editors such as XEmacs.


Release 2018c - 2018-01-22 23:00:44 -0800

  Briefly:
  Revert Irish changes that relied on negative SAVE values.

  Changes to tm_isdst

    Revert the 2018a change to Europe/Dublin.  As before, this change
    does not affect UT offsets or abbreviations; it affects only
    whether timestamps are considered to be standard time or
    daylight-saving time, as expressed in the tm_isdst flag of C's
    struct tm type.  This reversion is intended to be a temporary
    workaround for problems discovered with downstream uses of
    releases 2018a and 2018b, which implemented Irish time by using
    negative SAVE values in the Eire rules of the 'europe' file.
    Although negative SAVE values have been part of tzcode for many
    years and are supported by many platforms, they were not
    documented before 2018a and ICU and OpenJDK do not currently
    support them.  A mechanism to export data to platforms lacking
    support for negative DST is planned to be developed before the
    change is reapplied.  (Problems reported by Deborah Goldsmith and
    Stephen Colebourne.)

  Changes to past timestamps

    Japanese DST transitions (1948-1951) were Sundays at 00:00, not
    Saturdays or Sundays at 02:00.  (Thanks to Takayuki Nikai.)

  Changes to build procedure

    The build procedure now works around mawk 1.3.3's lack of support
    for character class expressions.  (Problem reported by Ohyama.)


Release 2018b - 2018-01-17 23:24:48 -0800

  Briefly:
  Fix a packaging problem in tz2018a, which was missing 'pacificnew'.

  Changes to build procedure

    The distribution now contains the file 'pacificnew' again.
    This file was inadvertently omitted in the 2018a distribution.
    (Problem reported by Matias Fonzo.)


Release 2018a - 2018-01-12 22:29:21 -0800

  Briefly:
  São Tomé and Príncipe switched from +00 to +01.
  Brazil's DST will now start on November's first Sunday.
  Ireland's standard time is now in the summer, not the winter.
  Use Debian-style installation locations, instead of 4.3BSD-style.
  New zic option -t.

  Changes to past and future timestamps

    São Tomé and Príncipe switched from +00 to +01 on 2018-01-01 at
    01:00.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen and Michael Deckers.)

  Changes to future timestamps

    Starting in 2018 southern Brazil will begin DST on November's
    first Sunday instead of October's third Sunday.  (Thanks to
    Steffen Thorsen.)

  Changes to past timestamps

    A discrepancy of 4 s in timestamps before 1931 in South Sudan has
    been corrected.  The 'backzone' and 'zone.tab' files did not agree
    with the 'africa' and 'zone1970.tab' files.  (Problem reported by
    Michael Deckers.)

    The abbreviation invented for Bolivia Summer Time (1931-2) is now
    BST instead of BOST, to be more consistent with the convention
    used for Latvian Summer Time (1918-9) and for British Summer Time.

  Changes to tm_isdst

    Change Europe/Dublin so that it observes Irish Standard Time (UT
    +01) in summer and GMT (as negative daylight-saving) in winter,
    instead of observing standard time (GMT) in winter and Irish
    Summer Time (UT +01) in summer.  This change does not affect UT
    offsets or abbreviations; it affects only whether timestamps are
    considered to be standard time or daylight-saving time, as
    expressed in the tm_isdst flag of C's struct tm type.
    (Discrepancy noted by Derick Rethans.)

  Changes to build procedure

    The default installation locations have been changed to mostly
    match Debian circa 2017, instead of being designed as an add-on to
    4.3BSD circa 1986.  This affects the Makefile macros TOPDIR,
    TZDIR, MANDIR, and LIBDIR.  New Makefile macros TZDEFAULT, USRDIR,
    USRSHAREDIR, BINDIR, ZDUMPDIR, and ZICDIR let installers tailor
    locations more precisely.  (This responds to suggestions from
    Brian Inglis and from Steve Summit.)

    The default installation procedure no longer creates the
    backward-compatibility link US/Pacific-New, which causes
    confusion during user setup (e.g., see Debian bug 815200).
    Use 'make BACKWARD="backward pacificnew"' to create the link
    anyway, for now.  Eventually we plan to remove the link entirely.

    tzdata.zi now contains a version-number comment.
    (Suggested by Tom Lane.)

    The Makefile now quotes values like BACKWARD more carefully when
    passing them to the shell.  (Problem reported by Zefram.)

    Builders no longer need to specify -DHAVE_SNPRINTF on platforms
    that have snprintf and use pre-C99 compilers.  (Problem reported
    by Jon Skeet.)

  Changes to code

    zic has a new option -t FILE that specifies the location of the
    file that determines local time when TZ is unset.  The default for
    this location can be configured via the new TZDEFAULT makefile
    macro, which defaults to /etc/localtime.

    Diagnostics and commentary now distinguish UT from UTC more
    carefully; see theory.html for more information about UT vs UTC.

    zic has been ported to GCC 8's -Wstringop-truncation option.
    (Problem reported by Martin Sebor.)

  Changes to documentation and commentary

    The zic man page now documents the longstanding behavior that
    times and years can be out of the usual range, with negative times
    counting backwards from midnight and with year 0 preceding year 1.
    (Problem reported by Michael Deckers.)

    The theory.html file now mentions the POSIX limit of six chars
    per abbreviation, and lists alphabetic abbreviations used.

    The files tz-art.htm and tz-link.htm have been renamed to
    tz-art.html and tz-link.html, respectively, for consistency with
    other file names and to simplify web server configuration.


Release 2017c - 2017-10-20 14:49:34 -0700

  Briefly:
  Northern Cyprus switches from +03 to +02/+03 on 2017-10-29.
  Fiji ends DST 2018-01-14, not 2018-01-21.
  Namibia switches from +01/+02 to +02 on 2018-04-01.
  Sudan switches from +03 to +02 on 2017-11-01.
  Tonga likely switches from +13/+14 to +13 on 2017-11-05.
  Turks & Caicos switches from -04 to -05/-04 on 2018-11-04.
  A new file tzdata.zi now holds a small text copy of all data.
  The zic input format has been regularized slightly.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Northern Cyprus has decided to resume EU rules starting
    2017-10-29, thus reinstituting winter time.

    Fiji ends DST 2018-01-14 instead of the 2018-01-21 previously
    predicted.  (Thanks to Dominic Fok.)  Adjust future predictions
    accordingly.

    Namibia will switch from +01 with DST to +02 all year on
    2017-09-03 at 02:00.  This affects UT offsets starting 2018-04-01
    at 02:00.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

    Sudan will switch from +03 to +02 on 2017-11-01.  (Thanks to Ahmed
    Atyya and Yahia Abdalla.)  South Sudan is not switching, so
    Africa/Juba is no longer a link to Africa/Khartoum.

    Tonga has likely ended its experiment with DST, and will not
    adjust its clocks on 2017-11-05.  Although Tonga has not announced
    whether it will continue to observe DST, the IATA is assuming that
    it will not.  (Thanks to David Wade.)

    Turks & Caicos will switch from -04 all year to -05 with US DST on
    2018-03-11 at 03:00.  This affects UT offsets starting 2018-11-04
    at 02:00.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Changes to past timestamps

    Namibia switched from +02 to +01 on 1994-03-21, not 1994-04-03.
    (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)

    Detroit did not observe DST in 1967.

    Use railway time for Asia/Kolkata before 1941, by switching to
    Madras local time (UT +052110) in 1870, then to IST (UT +0530) in
    1906.  Also, treat 1941-2's +0630 as DST, like 1942-5.

    Europe/Dublin's 1946 and 1947 fallback transitions occurred at
    02:00 standard time, not 02:00 DST.  (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)

    Pacific/Apia and Pacific/Pago_Pago switched from Antipodean to
    American time in 1892, not 1879.  (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)

    Adjust the 1867 transition in Alaska to better reflect the
    historical record, by changing it to occur on 1867-10-18 at 15:30
    Sitka time rather than at the start of 1867-10-17 local time.
    Although strictly speaking this is accurate only for Sitka,
    the rest of Alaska's blanks need to be filled in somehow.

    Fix off-by-one errors in UT offsets for Adak and Nome before 1867.
    (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)

    Add 7 s to the UT offset in Asia/Yangon before 1920.

  Changes to zone names

    Remove Canada/East-Saskatchewan from the 'backward' file, as it
    exceeded the 14-character limit and was an unused misnomer anyway.

  Changes to build procedure

    To support applications that prefer to read time zone data in text
    form, two zic input files tzdata.zi and leapseconds are now
    installed by default.  The commands 'zic tzdata.zi' and 'zic -L
    leapseconds tzdata.zi' can reproduce the tzdata binary files
    without and with leap seconds, respectively.  To prevent these two
    new files from being installed, use 'make TZDATA_TEXT=', and to
    suppress leap seconds from the tzdata text installation, use 'make
    TZDATA_TEXT=tzdata.zi'.

    'make BACKWARD=' now suppresses backward-compatibility names
    like 'US/Pacific' that are defined in the 'backward' and
    'pacificnew' files.

    'make check' now works on systems that lack a UTF-8 locale,
    or that lack the nsgmls program.  Set UTF8_LOCALE to configure
    the name of a UTF-8 locale, if you have one.

    Y2K runtime checks are no longer enabled by default.  Add
    -DDEPRECATE_TWO_DIGIT_YEARS to CFLAGS to enable them, instead of
    adding -DNO_RUN_TIME_WARNINGS_ABOUT_YEAR_2000_PROBLEMS_THANK_YOU
    to disable them.  (New name suggested by Brian Inglis.)

    The build procedure for zdump now works on AIX 7.1.
    (Problem reported by Kees Dekker.)

  Changes to code

    zic and the reference runtime now reject multiple leap seconds
    within 28 days of each other, or leap seconds before the Epoch.
    As a result, support for double leap seconds, which was
    obsolescent and undocumented, has been removed.  Double leap
    seconds were an error in the C89 standard; they have never existed
    in civil timekeeping.  (Thanks to Robert Elz and Bradley White for
    noticing glitches in the code that uncovered this problem.)

    zic now warns about use of the obsolescent and undocumented -y
    option, and about use of the obsolescent TYPE field of Rule lines.

    zic now allows unambiguous abbreviations like "Sa" and "Su" for
    weekdays; formerly it rejected them due to a bug.  Conversely, zic
    no longer considers non-prefixes to be abbreviations; for example,
    it no longer accepts "lF" as an abbreviation for "lastFriday".
    Also, zic warns about the undocumented usage with a "last-"
    prefix, e.g., "last-Fri".

    Similarly, zic now accepts the unambiguous abbreviation "L" for
    "Link" in ordinary context and for "Leap" in leap-second context.
    Conversely, zic no longer accepts non-prefixes such as "La" as
    abbreviations for words like "Leap".

    zic no longer accepts leap second lines in ordinary input, or
    ordinary lines in leap second input.  Formerly, zic sometimes
    warned about this undocumented usage and handled it incorrectly.

    The new macro HAVE_TZNAME governs whether the tzname external
    variable is exported, instead of USG_COMPAT.  USG_COMPAT now
    governs only the external variables "timezone" and "daylight".
    This change is needed because the three variables are not in the
    same category: although POSIX requires tzname, it specifies the
    other two variables as optional.  Also, USG_COMPAT is now 1 or 0:
    if not defined, the code attempts to guess it from other macros.

    localtime.c and difftime.c no longer require stdio.h, and .c files
    other than zic.c no longer require sys/wait.h.

    zdump.c no longer assumes snprintf.  (Reported by Jonathan Leffler.)

    Calculation of time_t extrema works around a bug in GCC 4.8.4
    (Reported by Stan Shebs and Joseph Myers.)

    zic.c no longer mistranslates formats of line numbers in non-English
    locales.  (Problem reported by Benno Schulenberg.)

    Several minor changes have been made to the code to make it a
    bit easier to port to MS-Windows and Solaris.  (Thanks to Kees
    Dekker for reporting the problems.)

  Changes to documentation and commentary

    The two new files 'theory.html' and 'calendars' contain the
    contents of the removed file 'Theory'.  The goal is to document
    tzdb theory more accessibly.

    The zic man page now documents abbreviation rules.

    tz-link.htm now covers how to apply tzdata changes to clients.
    (Thanks to Jorge Fábregas for the AIX link.)  It also mentions MySQL.

    The leap-seconds.list URL has been updated to something that is
    more reliable for tzdb.  (Thanks to Tim Parenti and Brian Inglis.)

Release 2017b - 2017-03-17 07:30:38 -0700

  Briefly: Haiti has resumed DST.

  Changes to past and future timestamps

    Haiti resumed observance of DST in 2017.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Changes to past timestamps

    Liberia changed from -004430 to +00 on 1972-01-07, not 1972-05-01.

    Use "MMT" to abbreviate Liberia's time zone before 1972, as "-004430"
    is one byte over the POSIX limit.  (Problem reported by Derick Rethans.)

  Changes to code

    The reference localtime implementation now falls back on the
    current US daylight-saving transition rules rather than the
    1987-2006 rules.  This fallback occurs only when (1) the TZ
    environment variable has a value like "AST4ADT" that asks
    for daylight saving time but does not specify the rules, (2) there
    is no file by that name, and (3) the TZDEFRULES file cannot be
    loaded.  (Thanks to Tom Lane.)


Release 2017a - 2017-02-28 00:05:36 -0800

  Briefly: Southern Chile moves from -04/-03 to -03, and Mongolia
  discontinues DST.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Mongolia no longer observes DST.  (Thanks to Ganbold Tsagaankhuu.)

    Chile's Region of Magallanes moves from -04/-03 to -03 year-round.
    Its clocks diverge from America/Santiago starting 2017-05-13 at
    23:00, hiving off a new zone America/Punta_Arenas.  Although the
    Chilean government says this change expires in May 2019, for now
    assume it's permanent.  (Thanks to Juan Correa and Deborah
    Goldsmith.)  This also affects Antarctica/Palmer.

  Changes to past timestamps

    Fix many entries for historical timestamps for Europe/Madrid
    before 1979, to agree with tables compiled by Pere Planesas of the
    National Astronomical Observatory of Spain.  As a side effect,
    this changes some timestamps for Africa/Ceuta before 1929, which
    are probably guesswork anyway.  (Thanks to Steve Allen and
    Pierpaolo Bernardi for the heads-ups, and to Michael Deckers for
    correcting the 1901 transition.)

    Ecuador observed DST from 1992-11-28 to 1993-02-05.
    (Thanks to Alois Treindl.)

    Asia/Atyrau and Asia/Oral were at +03 (not +04) before 1930-06-21.
    (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov.)

  Changes to past and future time zone abbreviations

    Switch to numeric time zone abbreviations for South America, as
    part of the ongoing project of removing invented abbreviations.
    This avoids the need to invent an abbreviation for the new Chilean
    new zone.  Similarly, switch from invented to numeric time zone
    abbreviations for Afghanistan, American Samoa, the Azores,
    Bangladesh, Bhutan, the British Indian Ocean Territory, Brunei,
    Cape Verde, Chatham Is, Christmas I, Cocos (Keeling) Is, Cook Is,
    Dubai, East Timor, Eucla, Fiji, French Polynesia, Greenland,
    Indochina, Iran, Iraq, Kiribati, Lord Howe, Macquarie, Malaysia,
    the Maldives, Marshall Is, Mauritius, Micronesia, Mongolia,
    Myanmar, Nauru, Nepal, New Caledonia, Niue, Norfolk I, Palau,
    Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Pitcairn, Qatar, Réunion, St
    Pierre & Miquelon, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles, Singapore,
    Solomon Is, Tokelau, Tuvalu, Wake, Vanuatu, Wallis & Futuna, and
    Xinjiang; for 20-minute daylight saving time in Ghana before 1943;
    for half-hour daylight saving time in Belize before 1944 and in
    the Dominican Republic before 1975; and for Canary Islands before
    1946, for Guinea-Bissau before 1975, for Iceland before 1969, for
    Indian Summer Time before 1942, for Indonesia before around 1964,
    for Kenya before 1960, for Liberia before 1973, for Madeira before
    1967, for Namibia before 1943, for the Netherlands in 1937-9, for
    Pakistan before 1971, for Western Sahara before 1977, and for
    Zaporozhye in 1880-1924.

    For Alaska time from 1900 through 1967, instead of "CAT" use the
    abbreviation "AST", the abbreviation commonly used at the time
    (Atlantic Standard Time had not been standardized yet).  Use "AWT"
    and "APT" instead of the invented abbreviations "CAWT" and "CAPT".

    Use "CST" and "CDT" instead of invented abbreviations for Macau
    before 1999 and Taiwan before 1938, and use "JST" instead of the
    invented abbreviation "JCST" for Japan and Korea before 1938.

  Change to database entry category

    Move the Pacific/Johnston link from 'australasia' to 'backward',
    since Johnston is now uninhabited.

  Changes to code

    zic no longer mishandles some transitions in January 2038 when it
    attempts to work around Qt bug 53071.  This fixes a bug affecting
    Pacific/Tongatapu that was introduced in zic 2016e.  localtime.c
    now contains a workaround, useful when loading a file generated by
    a buggy zic.  (Problem and localtime.c fix reported by Bradley
    White.)

    zdump -i now outputs non-hour numeric time zone abbreviations
    without a colon, e.g., "+0530" rather than "+05:30".  This agrees
    with zic %z and with common practice, and simplifies auditing of
    zdump output.

    zdump is now buildable again with -DUSE_LTZ=0.
    (Problem reported by Joseph Myers.)

    zdump.c now always includes private.h, to avoid code duplication
    with private.h.  (Problem reported by Kees Dekker.)

    localtime.c no longer mishandles early or late timestamps
    when TZ is set to a POSIX-style string that specifies DST.
    (Problem reported by Kees Dekker.)

    date and strftime now cause %z to generate "-0000" instead of
    "+0000" when the UT offset is zero and the time zone abbreviation
    begins with "-".

  Changes to documentation and commentary

    The 'Theory' file now better documents choice of historical time
    zone abbreviations.  (Problems reported by Michael Deckers.)

    tz-link.htm now covers leap smearing, which is popular in clouds.


Release 2016j - 2016-11-22 23:17:13 -0800

  Briefly: Saratov, Russia moves from +03 to +04 on 2016-12-04.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Saratov, Russia switches from +03 to +04 on 2016-12-04 at 02:00.
    This hives off a new zone Europe/Saratov from Europe/Volgograd.
    (Thanks to Yuri Konotopov and Stepan Golosunov.)

  Changes to past timestamps

    The new zone Asia/Atyrau for Atyraū Region, Kazakhstan, is like
    Asia/Aqtau except it switched from +05/+06 to +04/+05 in spring
    1999, not fall 1994.  (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov.)

  Changes to past time zone abbreviations

    Asia/Gaza and Asia/Hebron now use "EEST", not "EET", to denote
    summer time before 1948.  The old use of "EET" was a typo.

  Changes to code

    zic no longer mishandles file systems that lack hard links, fixing
    bugs introduced in 2016g.  (Problems reported by Tom Lane.)
    Also, when the destination already contains symbolic links, zic
    should now work better on systems where the 'link' system call
    does not follow symbolic links.

  Changes to documentation and commentary

    tz-link.htm now documents the relationship between release version
    numbers and development-repository commit tags.  (Suggested by
    Paul Koning.)

    The 'Theory' file now documents UT.

    iso3166.tab now accents "Curaçao", and commentary now mentions
    the names "Cabo Verde" and "Czechia".  (Thanks to Jiří Boháč.)


Release 2016i - 2016-11-01 23:19:52 -0700

  Briefly: Cyprus split into two time zones on 2016-10-30, and Tonga
  reintroduces DST on 2016-11-06.

  Changes to future timestamps

    Pacific/Tongatapu begins DST on 2016-11-06 at 02:00, ending on
    2017-01-15 at 03:00.  Assume future observances in Tonga will be
    from the first Sunday in November through the third Sunday in
    January, like Fiji.  (Thanks to Pulu ʻAnau.)  Switch to numeric
    time zone abbreviations for this zone.

  Changes to past and future timestamps

    Northern Cyprus is now +03 year round, causing a split in Cyprus
    time zones starting 2016-10-30 at 04:00.  This creates a zone
    Asia/Famagusta.  (Thanks to Even Scharning and Matt Johnson.)

    Antarctica/Casey switched from +08 to +11 on 2016-10-22.
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Changes to past timestamps

    Several corrections were made for pre-1975 timestamps in Italy.
    These affect Europe/Malta, Europe/Rome, Europe/San_Marino, and
    Europe/Vatican.

    First, the 1893-11-01 00:00 transition in Italy used the new UT
    offset (+01), not the old (+00:49:56).  (Thanks to Michael
    Deckers.)

    Second, rules for daylight saving in Italy were changed to agree
    with Italy's National Institute of Metrological Research (INRiM)
    except for 1944, as follows (thanks to Pierpaolo Bernardi, Brian
    Inglis, and Michael Deckers):

      The 1916-06-03 transition was at 24:00, not 00:00.

      The 1916-10-01, 1919-10-05, and 1920-09-19 transitions were at
      00:00, not 01:00.

      The 1917-09-30 and 1918-10-06 transitions were at 24:00, not
      01:00.

      The 1944-09-17 transition was at 03:00, not 01:00.  This
      particular change is taken from Italian law as INRiM's table,
      (which says 02:00) appears to have a typo here.  Also, keep the
      1944-04-03 transition for Europe/Rome, as Rome was controlled by
      Germany then.

      The 1967-1970 and 1972-1974 fallback transitions were at 01:00,
      not 00:00.

  Changes to code

    The code should now be buildable on AmigaOS merely by setting the
    appropriate Makefile variables.  (From a patch by Carsten Larsen.)


Release 2016h - 2016-10-19 23:17:57 -0700

  Changes to future timestamps

    Asia/Gaza and Asia/Hebron end DST on 2016-10-29 at 01:00, not
    2016-10-21 at 00:00.  (Thanks to Sharef Mustafa.)  Predict that
    future fall transitions will be on the last Saturday of October
    at 01:00, which is consistent with predicted spring transitions
    on the last Saturday of March.  (Thanks to Tim Parenti.)

  Changes to past timestamps

    In Turkey, transitions in 1986-1990 were at 01:00 standard time
    not at 02:00, and the spring 1994 transition was on March 20, not
    March 27.  (Thanks to Kıvanç Yazan.)

  Changes to past and future time zone abbreviations

    Asia/Colombo now uses numeric time zone abbreviations like "+0530"
    instead of alphabetic ones like "IST" and "LKT".  Various
    English-language sources use "IST", "LKT" and "SLST", with no
    working consensus.  (Usage of "SLST" mentioned by Sadika
    Sumanapala.)

  Changes to code

    zic no longer mishandles relativizing file names when creating
    symbolic links like /etc/localtime, when these symbolic links
    are outside the usual directory hierarchy.  This fixes a bug
    introduced in 2016g.  (Problem reported by Andreas Stieger.)

  Changes to build procedure

    New rules 'traditional_tarballs' and 'traditional_signatures' for
    building just the traditional-format distribution.  (Requested by
    Deborah Goldsmith.)

    The file 'version' is now put into the tzdata tarball too.
    (Requested by Howard Hinnant.)

  Changes to documentation and commentary

    The 'Theory' file now has a section on interface stability.
    (Requested by Paul Koning.)  It also mentions features like
    tm_zone and localtime_rz that have long been supported by the
    reference code.

    tz-link.htm has improved coverage of time zone boundaries suitable
    for geolocation.  (Thanks to heads-ups from Evan Siroky and Matt
    Johnson.)

    The US commentary now mentions Allen and the "day of two noons".

    The Fiji commentary mentions the government's 2016-10-03 press
    release.  (Thanks to Raymond Kumar.)


Release 2016g - 2016-09-13 08:56:38 -0700

  Changes to future timestamps

    Turkey switched from EET/EEST (+02/+03) to permanent +03,
    effective 2016-09-07.  (Thanks to Burak AYDIN.)  Use "+03" rather
    than an invented abbreviation for the new time.

    New leap second 2016-12-31 23:59:60 UTC as per IERS Bulletin C 52.
    (Thanks to Tim Parenti.)

  Changes to past timestamps

    For America/Los_Angeles, spring-forward transition times have been
    corrected from 02:00 to 02:01 in 1948, and from 02:00 to 01:00 in
    1950-1966.

    For zones using Soviet time on 1919-07-01, transitions to UT-based
    time were at 00:00 UT, not at 02:00 local time.  The affected
    zones are Europe/Kirov, Europe/Moscow, Europe/Samara, and
    Europe/Ulyanovsk.  (Thanks to Alexander Belopolsky.)

  Changes to past and future time zone abbreviations

    The Factory zone now uses the time zone abbreviation -00 instead
    of a long English-language string, as -00 is now the normal way to
    represent an undefined time zone.

    Several zones in Antarctica and the former Soviet Union, along
    with zones intended for ships at sea that cannot use POSIX TZ
    strings, now use numeric time zone abbreviations instead of
    invented or obsolete alphanumeric abbreviations.  The affected
    zones are Antarctica/Casey, Antarctica/Davis,
    Antarctica/DumontDUrville, Antarctica/Mawson, Antarctica/Rothera,
    Antarctica/Syowa, Antarctica/Troll, Antarctica/Vostok,
    Asia/Anadyr, Asia/Ashgabat, Asia/Baku, Asia/Bishkek, Asia/Chita,
    Asia/Dushanbe, Asia/Irkutsk, Asia/Kamchatka, Asia/Khandyga,
    Asia/Krasnoyarsk, Asia/Magadan, Asia/Omsk, Asia/Sakhalin,
    Asia/Samarkand, Asia/Srednekolymsk, Asia/Tashkent, Asia/Tbilisi,
    Asia/Ust-Nera, Asia/Vladivostok, Asia/Yakutsk, Asia/Yekaterinburg,
    Asia/Yerevan, Etc/GMT-14, Etc/GMT-13, Etc/GMT-12, Etc/GMT-11,
    Etc/GMT-10, Etc/GMT-9, Etc/GMT-8, Etc/GMT-7, Etc/GMT-6, Etc/GMT-5,
    Etc/GMT-4, Etc/GMT-3, Etc/GMT-2, Etc/GMT-1, Etc/GMT+1, Etc/GMT+2,
    Etc/GMT+3, Etc/GMT+4, Etc/GMT+5, Etc/GMT+6, Etc/GMT+7, Etc/GMT+8,
    Etc/GMT+9, Etc/GMT+10, Etc/GMT+11, Etc/GMT+12, Europe/Kaliningrad,
    Europe/Minsk, Europe/Samara, Europe/Volgograd, and
    Indian/Kerguelen.  For Europe/Moscow the invented abbreviation MSM
    was replaced by +05, whereas MSK and MSD were kept as they are not
    our invention and are widely used.

  Changes to zone names

    Rename Asia/Rangoon to Asia/Yangon, with a backward compatibility link.
    (Thanks to David Massoud.)

  Changes to code

    zic no longer generates binary files containing POSIX TZ-like
    strings that disagree with the local time type after the last
    explicit transition in the data.  This fixes a bug with
    Africa/Casablanca and Africa/El_Aaiun in some year-2037 timestamps
    on the reference platform.  (Thanks to Alexander Belopolsky for
    reporting the bug and suggesting a way forward.)

    If the installed localtime and/or posixrules files are symbolic
    links, zic now keeps them symbolic links when updating them, for
    compatibility with platforms like OpenSUSE where other programs
    configure these files as symlinks.

    zic now avoids hard linking to symbolic links, avoids some
    unnecessary mkdir and stat system calls, and uses shorter file
    names internally.

    zdump has a new -i option to generate transitions in a
    smaller but still human-readable format.  This option is
    experimental, and the output format may change in future versions.
    (Thanks to Jon Skeet for suggesting that an option was needed,
    and thanks to Tim Parenti and Chris Rovick for further comments.)

  Changes to build procedure

    An experimental distribution format is available, in addition
    to the traditional format which will continue to be distributed.
    The new format is a tarball tzdb-VERSION.tar.lz with signature
    file tzdb-VERSION.tar.lz.asc.  It unpacks to a top-level directory
    tzdb-VERSION containing the code and data of the traditional
    two-tarball format, along with extra data that may be useful.
    (Thanks to Antonio Diaz Diaz, Oscar van Vlijmen, and many others
    for comments about the experimental format.)

    The release version number is now more accurate in the usual case
    where releases are built from a Git repository.  For example, if
    23 commits and some working-file changes have been made since
    release 2016g, the version number is now something like
    '2016g-23-g50556e3-dirty' instead of the misleading '2016g'.
    Tagged releases use the same version number format as before,
    e.g., '2016g'.  To support the more accurate version number, its
    specification has moved from a line in the Makefile to a new
    source file 'version'.

    The experimental distribution contains a file to2050.tzs that
    contains what should be the output of 'zdump -i -c 2050' on
    primary zones.  If this file is available, 'make check' now checks
    that zdump generates this output.

    'make check_web' now works on Fedora-like distributions.

  Changes to documentation and commentary

    tzfile.5 now documents the new restriction on POSIX TZ-like
    strings that is now implemented by zic.

    Comments now cite URLs for some 1917-1921 Russian DST decrees.
    (Thanks to Alexander Belopolsky.)

    tz-link.htm mentions JuliaTime (thanks to Curtis Vogt) and Time4J
    (thanks to Meno Hochschild) and ThreeTen-Extra, and its
    description of Java 8 has been brought up to date (thanks to
    Stephen Colebourne).  Its description of local time on Mars has
    been updated to match current practice, and URLs have been updated
    and some obsolete ones removed.


Release 2016f - 2016-07-05 16:26:51 +0200

  Changes affecting future timestamps

    The Egyptian government changed its mind on short notice, and
    Africa/Cairo will not introduce DST starting 2016-07-07 after all.
    (Thanks to Mina Samuel.)

    Asia/Novosibirsk switches from +06 to +07 on 2016-07-24 at 02:00.
    (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov.)

  Changes to past and future timestamps

    Asia/Novokuznetsk and Asia/Novosibirsk now use numeric time zone
    abbreviations instead of invented ones.

  Changes affecting past timestamps

    Europe/Minsk's 1992-03-29 spring-forward transition was at 02:00 not 00:00.
    (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov.)


Release 2016e - 2016-06-14 08:46:16 -0700

  Changes affecting future timestamps

    Africa/Cairo observes DST in 2016 from July 7 to the end of October.
    Guess October 27 and 24:00 transitions.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)
    For future years, guess April's last Thursday to October's last
    Thursday except for Ramadan.

  Changes affecting past timestamps

    Locations while uninhabited now use '-00', not 'zzz', as a
    placeholder time zone abbreviation.  This is inspired by Internet
    RFC 3339 and is more consistent with numeric time zone
    abbreviations already used elsewhere.  The change affects several
    arctic and antarctic locations, e.g., America/Cambridge_Bay before
    1920 and Antarctica/Troll before 2005.

    Asia/Baku's 1992-09-27 transition from +04 (DST) to +04 (non-DST) was
    at 03:00, not 23:00 the previous day.  (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)

  Changes to code

    zic now outputs a dummy transition at time 2**31 - 1 in zones
    whose POSIX-style TZ strings contain a '<'.  This mostly works
    around Qt bug 53071 <https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-53071>.
    (Thanks to Zhanibek Adilbekov for reporting the Qt bug.)

  Changes affecting documentation and commentary

    tz-link.htm says why governments should give plenty of notice for
    time zone or DST changes, and refers to Matt Johnson's blog post.

    tz-link.htm mentions Tzdata for Elixir.  (Thanks to Matt Johnson.)


Release 2016d - 2016-04-17 22:50:29 -0700

  Changes affecting future timestamps

    America/Caracas switches from -0430 to -04 on 2016-05-01 at 02:30.
    (Thanks to Alexander Krivenyshev for the heads-up.)

    Asia/Magadan switches from +10 to +11 on 2016-04-24 at 02:00.
    (Thanks to Alexander Krivenyshev and Matt Johnson.)

    New zone Asia/Tomsk, split off from Asia/Novosibirsk.  It covers
    Tomsk Oblast, Russia, which switches from +06 to +07 on 2016-05-29
    at 02:00.  (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov.)

  Changes affecting past timestamps

    New zone Europe/Kirov, split off from Europe/Volgograd.  It covers
    Kirov Oblast, Russia, which switched from +04/+05 to +03/+04 on
    1989-03-26 at 02:00, roughly a year after Europe/Volgograd made
    the same change.  (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov.)

    Russia and nearby locations had daylight-saving transitions on
    1992-03-29 at 02:00 and 1992-09-27 at 03:00, instead of on
    1992-03-28 at 23:00 and 1992-09-26 at 23:00.  (Thanks to Stepan
    Golosunov.)

    Many corrections to historical time in Kazakhstan from 1991
    through 2005.  (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov.)  Replace Kazakhstan's
    invented time zone abbreviations with numeric abbreviations.

  Changes to commentary

    Mention Internet RFCs 7808 (TZDIST) and 7809 (CalDAV time zone references).


Release 2016c - 2016-03-23 00:51:27 -0700

  Changes affecting future timestamps

    Azerbaijan no longer observes DST.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

    Chile reverts from permanent to seasonal DST.  (Thanks to Juan
    Correa for the heads-up, and to Tim Parenti for corrections.)
    Guess that future transitions are August's and May's second
    Saturdays at 24:00 mainland time.  Also, call the period from
    2014-09-07 through 2016-05-14 daylight saving time instead of
    standard time, as that seems more appropriate now.

  Changes affecting past timestamps

    Europe/Kaliningrad and Europe/Vilnius changed from +03/+04 to
    +02/+03 on 1989-03-26, not 1991-03-31.  Europe/Volgograd changed
    from +04/+05 to +03/+04 on 1988-03-27, not 1989-03-26.
    (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov.)

  Changes to commentary

    Several updates and URLs for historical and proposed Russian changes.
    (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov, Matt Johnson, and Alexander Krivenyshev.)


Release 2016b - 2016-03-12 17:30:14 -0800

  Compatibility note

    Starting with release 2016b, some data entries cause zic implementations
    derived from tz releases 2005j through 2015e to issue warnings like
    "time zone abbreviation differs from POSIX standard (+03)".
    These warnings should not otherwise affect zic's output and can safely be
    ignored on today's platforms, as the warnings refer to a restriction in
    POSIX.1-1988 that was removed in POSIX.1-2001.  One way to suppress the
    warnings is to upgrade to zic derived from tz releases 2015f and later.

  Changes affecting future timestamps

    New zones Europe/Astrakhan and Europe/Ulyanovsk for Astrakhan and
    Ulyanovsk Oblasts, Russia, both of which will switch from +03 to +04 on
    2016-03-27 at 02:00 local time.  They need distinct zones since their
    post-1970 histories disagree.  New zone Asia/Barnaul for Altai Krai and
    Altai Republic, Russia, which will switch from +06 to +07 on the same date
    and local time.  The Astrakhan change is already official; the others have
    passed the first reading in the State Duma and are extremely likely.
    Also, Asia/Sakhalin moves from +10 to +11 on 2016-03-27 at 02:00.
    (Thanks to Alexander Krivenyshev for the heads-up, and to Matt Johnson
    and Stepan Golosunov for followup.)

    As a trial of a new system that needs less information to be made up,
    the new zones use numeric time zone abbreviations like "+04"
    instead of invented abbreviations like "ASTT".

    Haiti will not observe DST in 2016.  (Thanks to Jean Antoine via
    Steffen Thorsen.)

    Palestine's spring-forward transition on 2016-03-26 is at 01:00, not 00:00.
    (Thanks to Hannah Kreitem.) Guess future transitions will be March's last
    Saturday at 01:00, not March's last Friday at 24:00.

  Changes affecting past timestamps

    Europe/Chisinau observed DST during 1990, and switched from +04 to
    +03 at 1990-05-06 02:00, instead of switching from +03 to +02.
    (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov.)

    1991 abbreviations in Europe/Samara should be SAMT/SAMST, not
    KUYT/KUYST.  (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov.)

  Changes to code

    tzselect's diagnostics and checking, and checktab.awk's checking,
    have been improved.  (Thanks to J William Piggott.)

    tzcode now builds under MinGW.  (Thanks to Ian Abbott and Esben Haabendal.)

    tzselect now tests Julian-date TZ settings more accurately.
    (Thanks to J William Piggott.)

  Changes to commentary

    Comments in zone tables have been improved.  (Thanks to J William Piggott.)

    tzselect again limits its menu comments so that menus fit on a
    24×80 alphanumeric display.

    A new web page tz-how-to.html.  (Thanks to Bill Seymour.)

    In the Theory file, the description of possible time zone abbreviations in
    tzdata has been cleaned up, as the old description was unclear and
    inconsistent.  (Thanks to Alain Mouette for reporting the problem.)


Release 2016a - 2016-01-26 23:28:02 -0800

  Changes affecting future timestamps

    America/Cayman will not observe daylight saving this year after all.
    Revert our guess that it would.  (Thanks to Matt Johnson.)

    Asia/Chita switches from +0800 to +0900 on 2016-03-27 at 02:00.
    (Thanks to Alexander Krivenyshev.)

    Asia/Tehran now has DST predictions for the year 2038 and later,
    to be March 21 00:00 to September 21 00:00.  This is likely better
    than predicting no DST, albeit off by a day every now and then.

  Changes affecting past and future timestamps

    America/Metlakatla switched from PST all year to AKST/AKDT on
    2015-11-01 at 02:00.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

    America/Santa_Isabel has been removed, and replaced with a
    backward compatibility link to America/Tijuana.  Its contents were
    apparently based on a misreading of Mexican legislation.

  Changes affecting past timestamps

    Asia/Karachi's two transition times in 2002 were off by a minute.
    (Thanks to Matt Johnson.)

  Changes affecting build procedure

    An installer can now combine leap seconds with use of the backzone file,
    e.g., with 'make PACKRATDATA=backzone REDO=posix_right zones'.
    The old 'make posix_packrat' rule is now marked as obsolescent.
    (Thanks to Ian Abbott for an initial implementation.)

  Changes affecting documentation and commentary

    A new file LICENSE makes it easier to see that the code and data
    are mostly public-domain.  (Thanks to James Knight.)  The three
    non-public-domain files now use the current (3-clause) BSD license
    instead of older versions of that license.

    tz-link.htm mentions the BDE library (thanks to Andrew Paprocki),
    CCTZ (thanks to Tim Parenti), TimeJones.com, and has a new section
    on editing tz source files (with a mention of Sublime zoneinfo,
    thanks to Gilmore Davidson).

    The Theory and asia files now mention the 2015 book "The Global
    Transformation of Time, 1870-1950", and cite a couple of reviews.

    The America/Chicago entry now documents the informal use of US
    central time in Fort Pierre, South Dakota.  (Thanks to Rick
    McDermid, Matt Johnson, and Steve Jones.)


Release 2015g - 2015-10-01 00:39:51 -0700

  Changes affecting future timestamps

    Turkey's 2015 fall-back transition is scheduled for Nov. 8, not Oct. 25.
    (Thanks to Fatih.)

    Norfolk moves from +1130 to +1100 on 2015-10-04 at 02:00 local time.
    (Thanks to Alexander Krivenyshev.)

    Fiji's 2016 fall-back transition is scheduled for January 17, not 24.
    (Thanks to Ken Rylander.)

    Fort Nelson, British Columbia will not fall back on 2015-11-01.  It has
    effectively been on MST (-0700) since it advanced its clocks on 2015-03-08.
    New zone America/Fort_Nelson.  (Thanks to Matt Johnson.)

  Changes affecting past timestamps

    Norfolk observed DST from 1974-10-27 02:00 to 1975-03-02 02:00.

  Changes affecting code

    localtime no longer mishandles America/Anchorage after 2037.
    (Thanks to Bradley White for reporting the bug.)

    On hosts with signed 32-bit time_t, localtime no longer mishandles
    Pacific/Fiji after 2038-01-16 14:00 UTC.

    The localtime module allows the variables 'timezone', 'daylight',
    and 'altzone' to be in common storage shared with other modules,
    and declares them in case the system <time.h> does not.
    (Problems reported by Kees Dekker.)

    On platforms with tm_zone, strftime.c now assumes it is not NULL.
    This simplifies the code and is consistent with zdump.c.
    (Problem reported by Christos Zoulas.)

  Changes affecting documentation

   The tzfile man page now documents that transition times denote the
   starts (not the ends) of the corresponding time periods.
   (Ambiguity reported by Bill Seymour.)


Release 2015f - 2015-08-10 18:06:56 -0700

  Changes affecting future timestamps

    North Korea switches to +0830 on 2015-08-15.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)
    The abbreviation remains "KST".  (Thanks to Robert Elz.)

    Uruguay no longer observes DST.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen
    and Pablo Camargo.)

  Changes affecting past and future timestamps

    Moldova starts and ends DST at 00:00 UTC, not at 01:00 UTC.
    (Thanks to Roman Tudos.)

  Changes affecting data format and code

    zic's '-y YEARISTYPE' option is no longer documented.  The TYPE
    field of a Rule line should now be '-'; the old values 'even',
    'odd', 'uspres', 'nonpres', 'nonuspres' were already undocumented.
    Although the implementation has not changed, these features do not
    work in the default installation, they are not used in the data,
    and they are now considered obsolescent.

    zic now checks that two rules don't take effect at the same time.
    (Thanks to Jon Skeet and Arthur David Olson.)  Constraints on
    simultaneity are now documented.

    The two characters '%z' in a zone format now stand for the UT
    offset, e.g., '-07' for seven hours behind UT and '+0530' for
    five hours and thirty minutes ahead.  This better supports time
    zone abbreviations conforming to POSIX.1-2001 and later.

  Changes affecting installed data files

    Comments for America/Halifax and America/Glace_Bay have been improved.
    (Thanks to Brian Inglis.)

    Data entries have been simplified for Atlantic/Canary, Europe/Simferopol,
    Europe/Sofia, and Europe/Tallinn.  This yields slightly smaller
    installed data files for Europe/Simferopol and Europe/Tallinn.
    It does not affect timestamps.  (Thanks to Howard Hinnant.)

  Changes affecting code

    zdump and zic no longer warn about valid time zone abbreviations
    like '-05'.

    Some Visual Studio 2013 warnings have been suppressed.
    (Thanks to Kees Dekker.)

    'date' no longer sets the time of day and its -a, -d, -n and -t
    options have been removed.  Long obsolescent, the implementation
    of these features had porting problems.  Builders no longer need
    to configure HAVE_ADJTIME, HAVE_SETTIMEOFDAY, or HAVE_UTMPX_H.
    (Thanks to Kees Dekker for pointing out the problem.)

  Changes affecting documentation

    The Theory file mentions naming issues earlier, as these seem to be
    poorly publicized (thanks to Gilmore Davidson for reporting the problem).

    tz-link.htm mentions Time Zone Database Parser (thanks to Howard Hinnant).

    Mention that Herbert Samuel introduced the term "Summer Time".


Release 2015e - 2015-06-13 10:56:02 -0700

  Changes affecting future timestamps

    Morocco will suspend DST from 2015-06-14 03:00 through 2015-07-19 02:00,
    not 06-13 and 07-18 as we had guessed.  (Thanks to Milamber.)

    Assume Cayman Islands will observe DST starting next year, using US rules.
    Although it isn't guaranteed, it is the most likely.

  Changes affecting data format

    The file 'iso3166.tab' now uses UTF-8, so that its entries can better
    spell the names of Åland Islands, Côte d'Ivoire, and Réunion.

  Changes affecting code

    When displaying data, tzselect converts it to the current locale's
    encoding if the iconv command works.  (Problem reported by random832.)

    tzselect no longer mishandles Dominica, fixing a bug introduced
    in Release 2014f.  (Problem reported by Owen Leibman.)

    zic -l no longer fails when compiled with -DTZDEFAULT=\"/etc/localtime\".
    This fixes a bug introduced in Release 2014f.
    (Problem reported by Leonardo Chiquitto.)


Release 2015d - 2015-04-24 08:09:46 -0700

  Changes affecting future timestamps

    Egypt will not observe DST in 2015 and will consider canceling it
    permanently.  For now, assume no DST indefinitely.
    (Thanks to Ahmed Nazmy and Tim Parenti.)

  Changes affecting past timestamps

    America/Whitehorse switched from UT -09 to -08 on 1967-05-28, not
    1966-07-01.  Also, Yukon's time zone history is documented better.
    (Thanks to Brian Inglis and Dennis Ferguson.)

  Change affecting past and future time zone abbreviations

    The abbreviations for Hawaii-Aleutian standard and daylight times
    have been changed from HAST/HADT to HST/HDT, as per US Government
    Printing Office style.  This affects only America/Adak since 1983,
    as America/Honolulu was already using the new style.

  Changes affecting code

   zic has some minor performance improvements.


Release 2015c - 2015-04-11 08:55:55 -0700

  Changes affecting future timestamps

    Egypt's spring-forward transition is at 24:00 on April's last Thursday,
    not 00:00 on April's last Friday.  2015's transition will therefore be on
    Thursday, April 30 at 24:00, not Friday, April 24 at 00:00.  Similar fixes
    apply to 2026, 2037, 2043, etc.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Changes affecting past timestamps

    The following changes affect some pre-1991 Chile-related timestamps
    in America/Santiago, Antarctica/Palmer, and Pacific/Easter.

      The 1910 transition was January 10, not January 1.

      The 1918 transition was September 10, not September 1.

      The UT -04 time observed from 1932 to 1942 is now considered to
      be standard time, not year-round DST.

      Santiago observed DST (UT -03) from 1946-07-15 through
      1946-08-31, then reverted to standard time, then switched to -05
      on 1947-04-01.

      Assume transitions before 1968 were at 00:00, since we have no data
      saying otherwise.

      The spring 1988 transition was 1988-10-09, not 1988-10-02.
      The fall 1990 transition was 1990-03-11, not 1990-03-18.

      Assume no UT offset change for Pacific/Easter on 1890-01-01,
      and omit all transitions on Pacific/Easter from 1942 through 1946
      since we have no data suggesting that they existed.

    One more zone has been turned into a link, as it differed
    from an existing zone only for older timestamps.  As usual,
    this change affects UT offsets in pre-1970 timestamps only.
    The zone's old contents have been moved to the 'backzone' file.
    The affected zone is America/Montreal.

  Changes affecting commentary

    Mention the TZUpdater tool.

    Mention "The Time Now".  (Thanks to Brandon Ramsey.)


Release 2015b - 2015-03-19 23:28:11 -0700

  Changes affecting future timestamps

    Mongolia will start observing DST again this year, from the last
    Saturday in March at 02:00 to the last Saturday in September at 00:00.
    (Thanks to Ganbold Tsagaankhuu.)

    Palestine will start DST on March 28, not March 27.  Also,
    correct the fall 2014 transition from September 26 to October 24.
    Adjust future predictions accordingly.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Changes affecting past timestamps

    The 1982 zone shift in Pacific/Easter has been corrected, fixing a 2015a
    regression.  (Thanks to Stuart Bishop for reporting the problem.)

    Some more zones have been turned into links, when they differed
    from existing zones only for older timestamps.  As usual,
    these changes affect UT offsets in pre-1970 timestamps only.
    Their old contents have been moved to the 'backzone' file.
    The affected zones are: America/Antigua, America/Cayman,
    Pacific/Midway, and Pacific/Saipan.

  Changes affecting time zone abbreviations

    Correct the 1992-2010 DST abbreviation in Volgograd from "MSK" to "MSD".
    (Thanks to Hank W.)

  Changes affecting code

    Fix integer overflow bug in reference 'mktime' implementation.
    (Problem reported by Jörg Richter.)

    Allow -Dtime_tz=time_t compilations, and allow -Dtime_tz=... libraries
    to be used in the same executable as standard-library time_t functions.
    (Problems reported by Bradley White.)

  Changes affecting commentary

    Cite the recent Mexican decree changing Quintana Roo's time zone.
    (Thanks to Carlos Raúl Perasso.)

    Likewise for the recent Chilean decree.  (Thanks to Eduardo Romero Urra.)

    Update info about Mars time.


Release 2015a - 2015-01-29 22:35:20 -0800

  Changes affecting future timestamps

    The Mexican state of Quintana Roo, represented by America/Cancun,
    will shift from Central Time with DST to Eastern Time without DST
    on 2015-02-01 at 02:00.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen and Gwillim Law.)

    Chile will not change clocks in April or thereafter; its new standard time
    will be its old daylight saving time.  This affects America/Santiago,
    Pacific/Easter, and Antarctica/Palmer.  (Thanks to Juan Correa.)

    New leap second 2015-06-30 23:59:60 UTC as per IERS Bulletin C 49.
    (Thanks to Tim Parenti.)

  Changes affecting past timestamps

    Iceland observed DST in 1919 and 1921, and its 1939 fallback
    transition was Oct. 29, not Nov. 29.  Remove incorrect data from
    Shanks about time in Iceland between 1837 and 1908.

    Some more zones have been turned into links, when they differed
    from existing zones only for older timestamps.  As usual,
    these changes affect UT offsets in pre-1970 timestamps only.
    Their old contents have been moved to the 'backzone' file.
    The affected zones are: Asia/Aden, Asia/Bahrain, Asia/Kuwait,
    and Asia/Muscat.

  Changes affecting code

    tzalloc now scrubs time zone abbreviations compatibly with the way
    that tzset always has, by replacing invalid bytes with '_' and by
    shortening too-long abbreviations.

    tzselect ports to POSIX awk implementations, no longer mishandles
    POSIX TZ settings when GNU awk is used, and reports POSIX TZ
    settings to the user.  (Thanks to Stefan Kuhn.)

  Changes affecting build procedure

    'make check' now checks for links to links in the data.
    One such link (for Africa/Asmera) has been fixed.
    (Thanks to Stephen Colebourne for pointing out the problem.)

  Changes affecting commentary

    The leapseconds file commentary now mentions the expiration date.
    (Problem reported by Martin Burnicki.)

    Update Mexican Library of Congress URL.


Release 2014j - 2014-11-10 17:37:11 -0800

  Changes affecting current and future timestamps

    Turks & Caicos' switch from US eastern time to UT -04 year-round
    did not occur on 2014-11-02 at 02:00.  It's currently scheduled
    for 2015-11-01 at 02:00.  (Thanks to Chris Walton.)

  Changes affecting past timestamps

    Many pre-1989 timestamps have been corrected for Asia/Seoul and
    Asia/Pyongyang, based on sources for the Korean-language Wikipedia
    entry for time in Korea.  (Thanks to Sanghyuk Jung.)  Also, no
    longer guess that Pyongyang mimicked Seoul time after World War II,
    as this is politically implausible.

    Some more zones have been turned into links, when they differed
    from existing zones only for older timestamps.  As usual,
    these changes affect UT offsets in pre-1970 timestamps only.
    Their old contents have been moved to the 'backzone' file.
    The affected zones are: Africa/Addis_Ababa, Africa/Asmara,
    Africa/Dar_es_Salaam, Africa/Djibouti, Africa/Kampala,
    Africa/Mogadishu, Indian/Antananarivo, Indian/Comoro, and
    Indian/Mayotte.

  Changes affecting commentary

    The commentary is less enthusiastic about Shanks as a source,
    and is more careful to distinguish UT from UTC.


Release 2014i - 2014-10-21 22:04:57 -0700

  Changes affecting future timestamps

    Pacific/Fiji will observe DST from 2014-11-02 02:00 to 2015-01-18 03:00.
    (Thanks to Ken Rylander for the heads-up.)  Guess that future
    years will use a similar pattern.

    A new Zone Pacific/Bougainville, for the part of Papua New Guinea
    that plans to switch from UT +10 to +11 on 2014-12-28 at 02:00.
    (Thanks to Kiley Walbom for the heads-up.)

  Changes affecting time zone abbreviations

    Since Belarus is not changing its clocks even though Moscow is,
    the time zone abbreviation in Europe/Minsk is changing from FET
    to its more traditional value MSK on 2014-10-26 at 01:00.
    (Thanks to Alexander Bokovoy for the heads-up about Belarus.)

    The new abbreviation IDT stands for the pre-1976 use of UT +08 in
    Indochina, to distinguish it better from ICT (+07).

  Changes affecting past timestamps

    Many timestamps have been corrected for Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh before 1976
    (thanks to Trần Ngọc Quân for an indirect pointer to Trần Tiến Bình's
    authoritative book).  Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh has been added to
    zone1970.tab, to give tzselect users in Vietnam two choices,
    since north and south Vietnam disagreed after our 1970 cutoff.

    Asia/Phnom_Penh and Asia/Vientiane have been turned into links, as
    they differed from existing zones only for older timestamps.  As
    usual, these changes affect pre-1970 timestamps only.  Their old
    contents have been moved to the 'backzone' file.

  Changes affecting code

    The time-related library functions now set errno on failure, and
    some crashes in the new tzalloc-related library functions have
    been fixed.  (Thanks to Christos Zoulas for reporting most of
    these problems and for suggesting fixes.)

    If USG_COMPAT is defined and the requested timestamp is standard time,
    the tz library's localtime and mktime functions now set the extern
    variable timezone to a value appropriate for that timestamp; and
    similarly for ALTZONE, daylight saving time, and the altzone variable.
    This change is a companion to the tzname change in 2014h, and is
    designed to make timezone and altzone more compatible with tzname.

    The tz library's functions now set errno to EOVERFLOW if they fail
    because the result cannot be represented.  ctime and ctime_r now
    return NULL and set errno when a timestamp is out of range, rather
    than having undefined behavior.

    Some bugs associated with the new 2014g functions have been fixed.
    This includes a bug that largely incapacitated the new functions
    time2posix_z and posix2time_z.  (Thanks to Christos Zoulas.)
    It also includes some uses of uninitialized variables after tzalloc.
    The new code uses the standard type 'ssize_t', which the Makefile
    now gives porting advice about.

  Changes affecting commentary

    Updated URLs for NRC Canada (thanks to Matt Johnson and Brian Inglis).


Release 2014h - 2014-09-25 18:59:03 -0700

  Changes affecting past timestamps

    America/Jamaica's 1974 spring-forward transition was Jan. 6, not Apr. 28.

    Shanks says Asia/Novokuznetsk switched from LMT (not "NMT") on 1924-05-01,
    not 1920-01-06.  The old entry was based on a misinterpretation of Shanks.

    Some more zones have been turned into links, when they differed
    from existing zones only for older timestamps.  As usual,
    these changes affect UT offsets in pre-1970 timestamps only.
    Their old contents have been moved to the 'backzone' file.
    The affected zones are: Africa/Blantyre, Africa/Bujumbura,
    Africa/Gaborone, Africa/Harare, Africa/Kigali, Africa/Lubumbashi,
    Africa/Lusaka, Africa/Maseru, and Africa/Mbabane.

  Changes affecting code

    zdump -V and -v now output gmtoff= values on all platforms,
    not merely on platforms defining TM_GMTOFF.

    The tz library's localtime and mktime functions now set tzname to a value
    appropriate for the requested timestamp, and zdump now uses this
    on platforms not defining TM_ZONE, fixing a 2014g regression.
    (Thanks to Tim Parenti for reporting the problem.)

    The tz library no longer sets tzname if localtime or mktime fails.

    zdump -c no longer mishandles transitions near year boundaries.
    (Thanks to Tim Parenti for reporting the problem.)

    An access to uninitialized data has been fixed.
    (Thanks to Jörg Richter for reporting the problem.)

    When THREAD_SAFE is defined, the code ports to the C11 memory model.
    A memory leak has been fixed if ALL_STATE and THREAD_SAFE are defined
    and two threads race to initialize data used by gmtime-like functions.
    (Thanks to Andy Heninger for reporting the problems.)

  Changes affecting build procedure

    'make check' now checks better for properly sorted data.

  Changes affecting documentation and commentary

    zdump's gmtoff=N output is now documented, and its isdst=D output
    is now documented to possibly output D values other than 0 or 1.

    zdump -c's treatment of years is now documented to use the
    Gregorian calendar and Universal Time without leap seconds,
    and its behavior at cutoff boundaries is now documented better.
    (Thanks to Arthur David Olson and Tim Parenti for reporting the problems.)

    Programs are now documented to use the proleptic Gregorian calendar.
    (Thanks to Alan Barrett for the suggestion.)

    Fractional-second GMT offsets have been documented for civil time
    in 19th-century Chennai, Jakarta, and New York.


Release 2014g - 2014-08-28 12:31:23 -0700

  Changes affecting future timestamps

    Turks & Caicos is switching from US eastern time to UT -04
    year-round, modeled as a switch on 2014-11-02 at 02:00.
    [As noted in 2014j, this switch was later delayed.]

  Changes affecting past timestamps

    Time in Russia or the USSR before 1926 or so has been corrected by
    a few seconds in the following zones: Asia/Irkutsk,
    Asia/Krasnoyarsk, Asia/Omsk, Asia/Samarkand, Asia/Tbilisi,
    Asia/Vladivostok, Asia/Yakutsk, Europe/Riga, Europe/Samara.  For
    Asia/Yekaterinburg the correction is a few minutes.  (Thanks to
    Vladimir Karpinsky.)

    The Portuguese decree of 1911-05-26 took effect on 1912-01-01.
    This affects 1911 timestamps in Africa/Bissau, Africa/Luanda,
    Atlantic/Azores, and Atlantic/Madeira.  Also, Lisbon's pre-1912
    GMT offset was -0:36:45 (rounded from -0:36:44.68), not -0:36:32.
    (Thanks to Stephen Colebourne for pointing to the decree.)

    Asia/Dhaka ended DST on 2009-12-31 at 24:00, not 23:59.

    A new file 'backzone' contains data which may appeal to
    connoisseurs of old timestamps, although it is out of scope for
    the tz database, is often poorly sourced, and contains some data
    that is known to be incorrect.  The new file is not recommended
    for ordinary use and its entries are not installed by default.
    (Thanks to Lester Caine for the high-quality Jersey, Guernsey, and
    Isle of Man entries.)

    Some more zones have been turned into links, when they differed
    from existing zones only for older timestamps.  As usual,
    these changes affect UT offsets in pre-1970 timestamps only.
    Their old contents have been moved to the 'backzone' file.
    The affected zones are: Africa/Bangui, Africa/Brazzaville,
    Africa/Douala, Africa/Kinshasa, Africa/Libreville, Africa/Luanda,
    Africa/Malabo, Africa/Niamey, and Africa/Porto-Novo.

  Changes affecting code

    Unless NETBSD_INSPIRED is defined to 0, the tz library now
    supplies functions for creating and using objects that represent
    timezones. The new functions are tzalloc, tzfree, localtime_rz,
    mktime_z, and (if STD_INSPIRED is also defined) posix2time_z and
    time2posix_z.  They are intended for performance: for example,
    localtime_rz (unlike localtime_r) is trivially thread-safe without
    locking.  (Thanks to Christos Zoulas for proposing NetBSD-inspired
    functions, and to Alan Barrett and Jonathan Lennox for helping to
    debug the change.)

    zdump now builds with the tz library unless USE_LTZ is defined to 0,
    This lets zdump use tz features even if the system library lacks them.
    To build zdump with the system library, use 'make CFLAGS=-DUSE_LTZ=0
    TZDOBJS=zdump.o CHECK_TIME_T_ALTERNATIVES='.

    zdump now uses localtime_rz if available, as it's significantly faster,
    and it can help zdump better diagnose invalid timezone names.
    Define HAVE_LOCALTIME_RZ to 0 to suppress this.  HAVE_LOCALTIME_RZ
    defaults to 1 if NETBSD_INSPIRED && USE_LTZ.  When localtime_rz is
    not available, zdump now uses localtime_r and tzset if available,
    as this is a bit cleaner and faster than plain localtime.  Compile
    with -DHAVE_LOCALTIME_R=0 and/or -DHAVE_TZSET=0 if your system
    lacks these two functions.

    If THREAD_SAFE is defined to 1, the tz library is now thread-safe.
    Although not needed for tz's own applications, which are single-threaded,
    this supports POSIX better if the tz library is used in multithreaded apps.

    Some crashes have been fixed when zdump or the tz library is given
    invalid or outlandish input.

    The tz library no longer mishandles leap seconds on platforms with
    unsigned time_t in timezones that lack ordinary transitions after 1970.

    The tz code now attempts to infer TM_GMTOFF and TM_ZONE if not
    already defined, to make it easier to configure on common platforms.
    Define NO_TM_GMTOFF and NO_TM_ZONE to suppress this.

    Unless the new macro UNINIT_TRAP is defined to 1, the tz code now
    assumes that reading uninitialized memory yields garbage values
    but does not cause other problems such as traps.

    If TM_GMTOFF is defined and UNINIT_TRAP is 0, mktime is now
    more likely to guess right for ambiguous timestamps near
    transitions where tm_isdst does not change.

    If HAVE_STRFTIME_L is defined to 1, the tz library now defines
    strftime_l for compatibility with recent versions of POSIX.
    Only the C locale is supported, though.  HAVE_STRFTIME_L defaults
    to 1 on recent POSIX versions, and to 0 otherwise.

    tzselect -c now uses a hybrid distance measure that works better
    in Africa.  (Thanks to Alan Barrett for noting the problem.)

    The C source code now ports to NetBSD when GCC_DEBUG_FLAGS is used,
    or when time_tz is defined.

    When HAVE_UTMPX_H is set the 'date' command now builds on systems
    whose <utmpx.h> file does not define WTMPX_FILE, and when setting
    the date it updates the wtmpx file if _PATH_WTMPX is defined.
    This affects GNU/Linux and similar systems.

    For easier maintenance later, some C code has been simplified,
    some lint has been removed, and the code has been tweaked so that
    plain 'make' is more likely to work.

    The C type 'bool' is now used for boolean values, instead of 'int'.

    The long-obsolete LOCALE_HOME code has been removed.

    The long-obsolete 'gtime' function has been removed.

  Changes affecting build procedure

    'zdump' no longer links in ialloc.o, as it's not needed.

    'make check_time_t_alternatives' no longer assumes GNU diff.

  Changes affecting distribution tarballs

    The files checktab.awk and zoneinfo2tdf.pl are now distributed in
    the tzdata tarball instead of the tzcode tarball, since they help
    maintain the data.  The NEWS and Theory files are now also
    distributed in the tzdata tarball, as they're relevant for data.
    (Thanks to Alan Barrett for pointing this out.)  Also, the
    leapseconds.awk file is no longer distributed in the tzcode
    tarball, since it belongs in the tzdata tarball (where 2014f
    inadvertently also distributed it).

  Changes affecting documentation and commentary

    A new file CONTRIBUTING is distributed.  (Thanks to Tim Parenti for
    suggesting a CONTRIBUTING file, and to Tony Finch and Walter Harms
    for debugging it.)

    The man pages have been updated to use function prototypes,
    to document thread-safe variants like localtime_r, and to document
    the NetBSD-inspired functions tzalloc, tzfree, localtime_rz, and
    mktime_z.

    The fields in Link lines have been renamed to be more descriptive
    and more like the parameters of 'ln'.  LINK-FROM has become TARGET,
    and LINK-TO has become LINK-NAME.

    tz-link.htm mentions the IETF's tzdist working group; Windows
    Runtime etc. (thanks to Matt Johnson); and HP-UX's tztab.

    Some broken URLs have been fixed in the commentary.  (Thanks to
    Lester Caine.)

    Commentary about Philippines DST has been updated, and commentary
    on pre-1970 time in India has been added.


Release 2014f - 2014-08-05 17:42:36 -0700

  Changes affecting future timestamps

    Russia will subtract an hour from most of its time zones on 2014-10-26
    at 02:00 local time.  (Thanks to Alexander Krivenyshev.)
    There are a few exceptions: Magadan Oblast (Asia/Magadan) and Zabaykalsky
    Krai are subtracting two hours; conversely, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug
    (Asia/Anadyr), Kamchatka Krai (Asia/Kamchatka), Kemerovo Oblast
    (Asia/Novokuznetsk), and the Samara Oblast and the Udmurt Republic
    (Europe/Samara) are not changing their clocks.  The changed zones are
    Europe/Kaliningrad, Europe/Moscow, Europe/Simferopol, Europe/Volgograd,
    Asia/Yekaterinburg, Asia/Omsk, Asia/Novosibirsk, Asia/Krasnoyarsk,
    Asia/Irkutsk, Asia/Yakutsk, Asia/Vladivostok, Asia/Khandyga,
    Asia/Sakhalin, and Asia/Ust-Nera; Asia/Magadan will have two hours
    subtracted; and Asia/Novokuznetsk's time zone abbreviation is affected,
    but not its UTC offset.  Two zones are added: Asia/Chita (split
    from Asia/Yakutsk, and also with two hours subtracted) and
    Asia/Srednekolymsk (split from Asia/Magadan, but with only one hour
    subtracted).  (Thanks to Tim Parenti for much of the above.)

  Changes affecting time zone abbreviations

    Australian eastern time zone abbreviations are now AEST/AEDT not EST,
    and similarly for the other Australian zones.  That is, for eastern
    standard and daylight saving time the abbreviations are AEST and AEDT
    instead of the former EST for both; similarly, ACST/ACDT, ACWST/ACWDT,
    and AWST/AWDT are now used instead of the former CST, CWST, and WST.
    This change does not affect UT offsets, only time zone abbreviations.
    (Thanks to Rich Tibbett and many others.)

    Asia/Novokuznetsk shifts from NOVT to KRAT (remaining on UT +07)
    effective 2014-10-26 at 02:00 local time.

    The time zone abbreviation for Xinjiang Time (observed in Ürümqi)
    has been changed from URUT to XJT.  (Thanks to Luther Ma.)

    Prefer MSK/MSD for Moscow time in Russia, even in other cities.
    Similarly, prefer EET/EEST for eastern European time in Russia.

    Change time zone abbreviations in (western) Samoa to use "ST" and
    "DT" suffixes, as this is more likely to match common practice.
    Prefix "W" to (western) Samoa time when its standard-time offset
    disagrees with that of American Samoa.

    America/Metlakatla now uses PST, not MeST, to abbreviate its time zone.

    Time zone abbreviations have been updated for Japan's two time
    zones used 1896-1937.  JWST now stands for Western Standard
    Time, and JCST for Central Standard Time (formerly this was CJT).
    These abbreviations are now used for time in Korea, Taiwan,
    and Sakhalin while controlled by Japan.

  Changes affecting past timestamps

    China's five zones have been simplified to two, since the post-1970
    differences in the other three seem to have been imaginary.  The
    zones Asia/Harbin, Asia/Chongqing, and Asia/Kashgar have been
    removed; backwards-compatibility links still work, albeit with
    different behaviors for timestamps before May 1980.  Asia/Urumqi's
    1980 transition to UT +08 has been removed, so that it is now at
    +06 and not +08.  (Thanks to Luther Ma and to Alois Treindl;
    Treindl sent helpful translations of two papers by Guo Qingsheng.)

    Some zones have been turned into links, when they differed from existing
    zones only for older UT offsets where data entries were likely invented.
    These changes affect UT offsets in pre-1970 timestamps only.  This is
    similar to the change in release 2013e, except this time for western
    Africa.  The affected zones are: Africa/Bamako, Africa/Banjul,
    Africa/Conakry, Africa/Dakar, Africa/Freetown, Africa/Lome,
    Africa/Nouakchott, Africa/Ouagadougou, Africa/Sao_Tome, and
    Atlantic/St_Helena.  This also affects the backwards-compatibility
    link Africa/Timbuktu.  (Thanks to Alan Barrett, Stephen Colebourne,
    Tim Parenti, and David Patte for reporting problems in earlier
    versions of this change.)

    Asia/Shanghai's pre-standard-time UT offset has been changed from
    8:05:57 to 8:05:43, the location of Xujiahui Observatory.  Its
    transition to standard time has been changed from 1928 to 1901.

    Asia/Taipei switched to JWST on 1896-01-01, then to JST on 1937-10-01,
    then to CST on 1945-09-21 at 01:00, and did not observe DST in 1945.
    In 1946 it observed DST from 05-15 through 09-30; in 1947
    from 04-15 through 10-31; and in 1979 from 07-01 through 09-30.
    (Thanks to Yu-Cheng Chuang.)

    Asia/Riyadh's transition to standard time is now 1947-03-14, not 1950.

    Europe/Helsinki's 1942 fall-back transition was 10-04 at 01:00, not
    10-03 at 00:00.  (Thanks to Konstantin Hyppönen.)

    Pacific/Pago_Pago has been changed from UT -11:30 to -11 for the
    period from 1911 to 1950.

    Pacific/Chatham has been changed to New Zealand standard time plus
    45 minutes for the period before 1957, reflecting a 1956 remark in
    the New Zealand parliament.

    Europe/Budapest has several pre-1946 corrections: in 1918 the transition
    out of DST was on 09-16, not 09-29; in 1919 it was on 11-24, not 09-15; in
    1945 it was on 11-01, not 11-03; in 1941 the transition to DST was 04-08
    not 04-06 at 02:00; and there was no DST in 1920.

    Africa/Accra is now assumed to have observed DST from 1920 through 1935.

    Time in Russia before 1927 or so has been corrected by a few seconds in
    the following zones: Europe/Moscow, Asia/Irkutsk, Asia/Tbilisi,
    Asia/Tashkent, Asia/Vladivostok, Asia/Yekaterinburg, Europe/Helsinki, and
    Europe/Riga.  Also, Moscow's location has been changed to its Kilometer 0
    point.  (Thanks to Vladimir Karpinsky for the Moscow changes.)

  Changes affecting data format

    A new file 'zone1970.tab' supersedes 'zone.tab' in the installed data.
    The new file's extended format allows multiple country codes per zone.
    The older file is still installed but is deprecated; its format is
    not changing and it will still be distributed for a while, but new
    applications should use the new file.

    The new file format simplifies maintenance of obscure locations.
    To test this, it adds coverage for the Crozet Islands and the
    Scattered Islands.  (Thanks to Tobias Conradi and Antoine Leca.)

    The file 'iso3166.tab' is planned to switch from ASCII to UTF-8.
    It is still ASCII now, but commentary about the switch has been added.
    The new file 'zone1970.tab' already uses UTF-8.

  Changes affecting code

    'localtime', 'mktime', etc. now use much less stack space if ALL_STATE
    is defined.  (Thanks to Elliott Hughes for reporting the problem.)

    'zic' no longer mishandles input when ignoring case in locales that
    are not compatible with English, e.g., unibyte Turkish locales when
    compiled with HAVE_GETTEXT.

    Error diagnostics of 'zic' and 'yearistype' have been reworded so that
    they no longer use ASCII '-' as if it were a dash.

    'zic' now rejects output file names that contain '.' or '..' components.
    (Thanks to Tim Parenti for reporting the problem.)

    'zic -v' now warns about output file names that do not follow
    POSIX rules, or that contain a digit or '.'.  (Thanks to Arthur
    David Olson for starting the ball rolling on this.)

    Some lint has been removed when using GCC_DEBUG_FLAGS with GCC 4.9.0.

  Changes affecting build procedure

    'zic' no longer links in localtime.o and asctime.o, as they're not needed.
    (Thanks to John Cochran.)

  Changes affecting documentation and commentary

    The 'Theory' file documents legacy names, the longstanding
    exceptions to the POSIX-inspired file name rules.

    The 'zic' documentation clarifies the role of time types when
    interpreting dates.  (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)

    Documentation and commentary now prefer UTF-8 to US-ASCII,
    allowing the use of proper accents in foreign words and names.
    Code and data have not changed because of this.  (Thanks to
    Garrett Wollman, Ian Abbott, and Guy Harris for helping to debug
    this.)

    Non-HTML documentation and commentary now use plain-text URLs instead of
    HTML insertions, and are more consistent about bracketing URLs when they
    are not already surrounded by white space.  (Thanks to suggestions by
    Steffen Nurpmeso.)

    There is new commentary about Xujiahui Observatory, the five time-zone
    project in China from 1918 to 1949, timekeeping in Japanese-occupied
    Shanghai, and Tibet Time in the 1950s.  The sharp-eyed can spot the
    warlord Jin Shuren in the data.

    Commentary about the coverage of each Russian zone has been standardized.
    (Thanks to Tim Parenti.)

    There is new commentary about contemporary timekeeping in Ethiopia.

    Obsolete comments about a 2007 proposal for DST in Kuwait has been removed.

    There is new commentary about time in Poland in 1919.

    Proper credit has been given to DST inventor George Vernon Hudson.

    Commentary about time in Metlakatla, AK and Resolute, NU has been
    improved, with a new source for the former.

    In zone.tab, Pacific/Easter no longer mentions Salas y Gómez, as it
    is uninhabited.

    Commentary about permanent Antarctic bases has been updated.

    Several typos have been corrected.  (Thanks to Tim Parenti for
    contributing some of these fixes.)

    tz-link.htm now mentions the JavaScript libraries Moment Timezone,
    TimezoneJS.Date, Walltime-js, and Timezone.  (Thanks to a heads-up
    from Matt Johnson.)  Also, it mentions the Go 'latlong' package.
    (Thanks to a heads-up from Dirkjan Ochtman.)

    The files usno1988, usno1989, usno1989a, usno1995, usno1997, and usno1998
    have been removed.  These obsolescent US Naval Observatory entries were no
    longer helpful for maintenance.  (Thanks to Tim Parenti for the suggestion.)


Release 2014e - 2014-06-12 21:53:52 -0700

  Changes affecting near-future timestamps

    Egypt's 2014 Ramadan-based transitions are June 26 and July 31 at 24:00.
    (Thanks to Imed Chihi.)  Guess that from 2015 on Egypt will temporarily
    switch to standard time at 24:00 the last Thursday before Ramadan, and
    back to DST at 00:00 the first Friday after Ramadan.

    Similarly, Morocco's are June 28 at 03:00 and August 2 at 02:00.  (Thanks
    to Milamber Space Network.)  Guess that from 2015 on Morocco will
    temporarily switch to standard time at 03:00 the last Saturday before
    Ramadan, and back to DST at 02:00 the first Saturday after Ramadan.

  Changes affecting past timestamps

    The abbreviation "MSM" (Moscow Midsummer Time) is now used instead of
    "MSD" for Moscow's double daylight time in summer 1921.  Also, a typo
    "VLASST" has been repaired to be "VLAST" for Vladivostok summer time
    in 1991.  (Thanks to Hank W. for reporting the problems.)

  Changes affecting commentary

    tz-link.htm now cites RFC 7265 for jCal, mentions PTP and the
    draft CalDAV extension, updates URLs for TSP, TZInfo, IATA, and
    removes stale pointers to World Time Explorer and WORLDTIME.


Release 2014d - 2014-05-27 21:34:40 -0700

  Changes affecting code

    zic no longer generates files containing timestamps before the Big Bang.
    This works around GNOME glib bug 878
    <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/issues/878>
    (Thanks to Leonardo Chiquitto for reporting the bug, and to
    Arthur David Olson and James Cloos for suggesting improvements to the fix.)

  Changes affecting documentation

    tz-link.htm now mentions GNOME.


Release 2014c - 2014-05-13 07:44:13 -0700

  Changes affecting near-future timestamps

    Egypt observes DST starting 2014-05-15 at 24:00.
    (Thanks to Ahmad El-Dardiry and Gunther Vermier.)
    Details have not been announced, except that DST will not be observed
    during Ramadan.  Guess that DST will stop during the same Ramadan dates as
    Morocco, and that Egypt's future spring and fall transitions will be the
    same as 2010 when it last observed DST, namely April's last Friday at
    00:00 to September's last Thursday at 23:00 standard time.  Also, guess
    that Ramadan transitions will be at 00:00 standard time.

  Changes affecting code

    zic now generates transitions for minimum time values, eliminating guesswork
    when handling low-valued timestamps.  (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)

    Port to Cygwin sans glibc.  (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)

  Changes affecting commentary and documentation

    Remove now-confusing comment about Jordan.  (Thanks to Oleksii Nochovnyi.)


Release 2014b - 2014-03-24 21:28:50 -0700

  Changes affecting near-future timestamps

    Crimea switches to Moscow time on 2014-03-30 at 02:00 local time.
    (Thanks to Alexander Krivenyshev.)  Move its zone.tab entry from UA to RU.

    New entry for Troll station, Antarctica.  (Thanks to Paul-Inge Flakstad and
    Bengt-Inge Larsson.)  This is currently an approximation; a better version
    will require the zic and localtime fixes mentioned below, and the plan is
    to wait for a while until at least the zic fixes propagate.

  Changes affecting code

    'zic' and 'localtime' no longer reject locations needing four transitions
    per year for the foreseeable future.  (Thanks to Andrew Main (Zefram).)
    Also, 'zic' avoids some unlikely failures due to integer overflow.

  Changes affecting build procedure

    'make check' now detects Rule lines defined but never used.
    The NZAQ rules, an instance of this problem, have been removed.

  Changes affecting commentary and documentation

    Fix Tuesday/Thursday typo in description of time in Israel.
    (Thanks to Bert Katz via Pavel Kharitonov and Mike Frysinger.)

    Microsoft Windows 8.1 doesn't support tz database names.  (Thanks
    to Donald MacQueen.)  Instead, the Microsoft Windows Store app
    library supports them.

    Add comments about Johnston Island time in the 1960s.
    (Thanks to Lyle McElhaney.)

    Morocco's 2014 DST start will be as predicted.
    (Thanks to Sebastien Willemijns.)


Release 2014a - 2014-03-07 23:30:29 -0800

  Changes affecting near-future timestamps

    Turkey begins DST on 2014-03-31, not 03-30.  (Thanks to Faruk Pasin for
    the heads-up, and to Tim Parenti for simplifying the update.)

  Changes affecting past timestamps

    Fiji ended DST on 2014-01-19 at 02:00, not the previously scheduled 03:00.
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

    Ukraine switched from Moscow to Eastern European time on 1990-07-01
    (not 1992-01-01), and observed DST during the entire next winter.
    (Thanks to Vladimir in Moscow via Alois Treindl.)

    In 1988 Israel observed DST from 04-10 to 09-04, not 04-09 to 09-03.
    (Thanks to Avigdor Finkelstein.)

  Changes affecting code

    A uninitialized-storage bug in 'localtime' has been fixed.
    (Thanks to Logan Chien.)

  Changes affecting the build procedure

    The settings for 'make check_web' now default to Ubuntu 13.10.

  Changes affecting commentary and documentation

    The boundary of the US Pacific time zone is given more accurately.
    (Thanks to Alan Mintz.)

    Chile's 2014 DST will be as predicted.  (Thanks to José Miguel Garrido.)

    Paraguay's 2014 DST will be as predicted.  (Thanks to Carlos Raúl Perasso.)

    Better descriptions of countries with same time zone history as
    Trinidad and Tobago since 1970.  (Thanks to Alan Barrett for suggestion.)

    Several changes affect tz-link.htm, the main web page.

      Mention Time.is (thanks to Even Scharning) and WX-now (thanks to
      David Braverman).

      Mention xCal (Internet RFC 6321) and jCal.

      Microsoft has some support for tz database names.

      CLDR data formats include both XML and JSON.

      Mention Maggiolo's map of solar vs standard time.
      (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)

      Mention TZ4Net.  (Thanks to Matt Johnson.)

      Mention the timezone-olson Haskell package.

      Mention zeitverschiebung.net.  (Thanks to Martin Jäger.)

      Remove moribund links to daylight-savings-time.info and to
      Simple Timer + Clocks.

      Update two links.  (Thanks to Oscar van Vlijmen.)

      Fix some formatting glitches, e.g., remove random newlines from
      abbr elements' title attributes.


Release 2013i - 2013-12-17 07:25:23 -0800

  Changes affecting near-future timestamps:

    Jordan switches back to standard time at 00:00 on December 20, 2013.
    The 2006-2011 transition schedule is planned to resume in 2014.
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Changes affecting past timestamps:

    In 2004, Cuba began DST on March 28, not April 4.
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Changes affecting code

    The compile-time flag NOSOLAR has been removed, as nowadays the
    benefit of slightly shrinking runtime table size is outweighed by the
    cost of disallowing potential future updates that exceed old limits.

  Changes affecting documentation and commentary

    The files solar87, solar88, and solar89 are no longer distributed.
    They were a negative experiment - that is, a demonstration that
    tz data can represent solar time only with some difficulty and error.
    Their presence in the distribution caused confusion, as Riyadh
    civil time was generally not solar time in those years.

    tz-link.htm now mentions Noda Time.  (Thanks to Matt Johnson.)


Release 2013h - 2013-10-25 15:32:32 -0700

  Changes affecting current and future timestamps:

    Libya has switched its UT offset back to +02 without DST, instead
    of +01 with DST.  (Thanks to Even Scharning.)

    Western Sahara (Africa/El_Aaiun) uses Morocco's DST rules.
    (Thanks to Gwillim Law.)

  Changes affecting future timestamps:

    Acre and (we guess) western Amazonas will switch from UT -04 to -05
    on 2013-11-10.  This affects America/Rio_Branco and America/Eirunepe.
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

    Add entries for DST transitions in Morocco in the year 2038.
    This avoids some year-2038 glitches introduced in 2013g.
    (Thanks to Yoshito Umaoka for reporting the problem.)

  Changes affecting API

    The 'tzselect' command no longer requires the 'select' command,
    and should now work with /bin/sh on more platforms.  It also works
    around a bug in BusyBox awk before version 1.21.0.  (Thanks to
    Patrick 'P. J.' McDermott and Alan Barrett.)

  Changes affecting code

    Fix localtime overflow bugs with 32-bit unsigned time_t.

    zdump no longer assumes sscanf returns maximal values on overflow.

  Changes affecting the build procedure

    The builder can specify which programs to use, if any, instead of
    'ar' and 'ranlib', and libtz.a is now built locally before being
    installed.  (Thanks to Michael Forney.)

    A dependency typo in the 'zdump' rule has been fixed.
    (Thanks to Andrew Paprocki.)

    The Makefile has been simplified by assuming that 'mkdir -p' and 'cp -f'
    work as specified by POSIX.2-1992 or later; this is portable nowadays.

    'make clean' no longer removes 'leapseconds', since it's
    host-independent and is part of the distribution.

    The unused makefile macros TZCSRCS, TZDSRCS, DATESRCS have been removed.

  Changes affecting documentation and commentary

    tz-link.htm now mentions TC TIMEZONE's draft time zone service protocol
    (thanks to Mike Douglass) and TimezoneJS.Date (thanks to Jim Fehrle).

    Update URLs in tz-link page.  Add URLs for Microsoft Windows, since
    8.1 introduces tz support.  Remove URLs for Tru64 and UnixWare (no
    longer maintained) and for old advisories.  SOFA now does C.

Release 2013g - 2013-09-30 21:08:26 -0700

  Changes affecting current and near-future timestamps

    Morocco now observes DST from the last Sunday in March to the last
    Sunday in October, not April to September respectively.  (Thanks
    to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Changes affecting 'zic'

    'zic' now runs on platforms that lack both hard links and symlinks.
    (Thanks to Theo Veenker for reporting the problem, for MinGW.)
    Also, fix some bugs on platforms that lack hard links but have symlinks.

    'zic -v' again warns that Asia/Tehran has no POSIX environment variable
    to predict the far future, fixing a bug introduced in 2013e.

  Changes affecting the build procedure

    The 'leapseconds' file is again put into the tzdata tarball.
    Also, 'leapseconds.awk', so tzdata is self-contained.  (Thanks to
    Matt Burgess and Ian Abbott.)  The timestamps of these and other
    dependent files in tarballs are adjusted more consistently.

  Changes affecting documentation and commentary

    The README file is now part of the data tarball as well as the code.
    It now states that files are public domain unless otherwise specified.
    (Thanks to Andrew Main (Zefram) for asking for clarifications.)
    Its details about the 1989 release moved to a place of honor near
    the end of NEWS.


Release 2013f - 2013-09-24 23:37:36 -0700

  Changes affecting near-future timestamps

    Tocantins will very likely not observe DST starting this spring.
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

    Jordan will likely stay at UT +03 indefinitely, and will not fall
    back this fall.

    Palestine will fall back at 00:00, not 01:00.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Changes affecting API

    The types of the global variables 'timezone' and 'altzone' (if present)
    have been changed back to 'long'.  This is required for 'timezone'
    by POSIX, and for 'altzone' by common practice, e.g., Solaris 11.
    These variables were originally 'long' in the tz code, but were
    mistakenly changed to 'time_t' in 1987; nobody reported the
    incompatibility until now.  The difference matters on x32, where
    'long' is 32 bits and 'time_t' is 64.  (Thanks to Elliott Hughes.)

  Changes affecting the build procedure

    Avoid long strings in leapseconds.awk to work around a mawk bug.
    (Thanks to Cyril Baurand.)

  Changes affecting documentation and commentary

    New file 'NEWS' that contains release notes like this one.

    Paraguay's law does not specify DST transition time; 00:00 is customary.
    (Thanks to Waldemar Villamayor-Venialbo.)

    Minor capitalization fixes.

  Changes affecting version-control only

    The experimental GitHub repository now contains annotated and
    signed tags for recent releases, e.g., '2013e' for Release 2013e.
    Releases are tagged starting with 2012e; earlier releases were
    done differently, and tags would either not have a simple name or
    not exactly match what was released.

    'make set-timestamps' is now simpler and a bit more portable.


Release 2013e - 2013-09-19 23:50:04 -0700

  Changes affecting near-future timestamps

    This year Fiji will start DST on October 27, not October 20.
    (Thanks to David Wheeler for the heads-up.)  For now, guess that
    Fiji will continue to spring forward the Sunday before the fourth
    Monday in October.

  Changes affecting current and future time zone abbreviations

    Use WIB/WITA/WIT rather than WIT/CIT/EIT for alphabetic Indonesian
    time zone abbreviations since 1932.  (Thanks to George Ziegler,
    Priyadi Iman Nurcahyo, Zakaria, Jason Grimes, Martin Pitt, and
    Benny Lin.)  This affects Asia/Dili, Asia/Jakarta, Asia/Jayapura,
    Asia/Makassar, and Asia/Pontianak.

    Use ART (UT -03, standard time), rather than WARST (also -03, but
    daylight saving time) for San Luis, Argentina since 2009.

  Changes affecting Godthåb timestamps after 2037 if version mismatch

    Allow POSIX-like TZ strings where the transition time's hour can
    range from -167 through 167, instead of the POSIX-required 0
    through 24.  E.g., TZ='FJT-12FJST,M10.3.1/146,M1.3.4/75' for the
    new Fiji rules.  This is a more compact way to represent
    far-future timestamps for America/Godthab, America/Santiago,
    Antarctica/Palmer, Asia/Gaza, Asia/Hebron, Asia/Jerusalem,
    Pacific/Easter, and Pacific/Fiji.  Other zones are unaffected by
    this change.  (Derived from a suggestion by Arthur David Olson.)

    Allow POSIX-like TZ strings where daylight saving time is in
    effect all year.  E.g., TZ='WART4WARST,J1/0,J365/25' for Western
    Argentina Summer Time all year.  This supports a more compact way
    to represent the 2013d data for America/Argentina/San_Luis.
    Because of the change for San Luis noted above this change does not
    affect the current data.  (Thanks to Andrew Main (Zefram) for
    suggestions that improved this change.)

    Where these two TZ changes take effect, there is a minor extension
    to the tz file format in that it allows new values for the
    embedded TZ-format string, and the tz file format version number
    has therefore been increased from 2 to 3 as a precaution.
    Version-2-based client code should continue to work as before for
    all timestamps before 2038.  Existing version-2-based client code
    (tzcode, GNU/Linux, Solaris) has been tested on version-3-format
    files, and typically works in practice even for timestamps after
    2037; the only known exception is America/Godthab.

  Changes affecting timestamps before 1970

    Pacific/Johnston is now a link to Pacific/Honolulu.  This corrects
    some errors before 1947.

    Some zones have been turned into links, when they differ from existing
    zones only in older data entries that were likely invented or that
    differ only in LMT or transitions from LMT.  These changes affect
    only timestamps before 1943.  The affected zones are:
    Africa/Juba, America/Anguilla, America/Aruba, America/Dominica,
    America/Grenada, America/Guadeloupe, America/Marigot,
    America/Montserrat, America/St_Barthelemy, America/St_Kitts,
    America/St_Lucia, America/St_Thomas, America/St_Vincent,
    America/Tortola, and Europe/Vaduz.  (Thanks to Alois Treindl for
    confirming that the old Europe/Vaduz zone was wrong and the new
    link is better for WWII-era times.)

    Change Kingston Mean Time from -5:07:12 to -5:07:11.  This affects
    America/Cayman, America/Jamaica and America/Grand_Turk timestamps
    from 1890 to 1912.

    Change the UT offset of Bern Mean Time from 0:29:44 to 0:29:46.
    This affects Europe/Zurich timestamps from 1853 to 1894.  (Thanks
    to Alois Treindl.)

    Change the date of the circa-1850 Zurich transition from 1849-09-12
    to 1853-07-16, overriding Shanks with data from Messerli about
    postal and telegraph time in Switzerland.

  Changes affecting time zone abbreviations before 1970

    For Asia/Jakarta, use BMT (not JMT) for mean time from 1923 to 1932,
    as Jakarta was called Batavia back then.

  Changes affecting API

    The 'zic' command now outputs a dummy transition when far-future
    data can't be summarized using a TZ string, and uses a 402-year
    window rather than a 400-year window.  For the current data, this
    affects only the Asia/Tehran file.  It does not affect any of the
    timestamps that this file represents, so zdump outputs the same
    information as before.  (Thanks to Andrew Main (Zefram).)

    The 'date' command has a new '-r' option, which lets you specify
    the integer time to display, a la FreeBSD.

    The 'tzselect' command has two new options '-c' and '-n', which lets you
    select a zone based on latitude and longitude.

    The 'zic' command's '-v' option now warns about constructs that
    require the new version-3 binary file format.  (Thanks to Arthur
    David Olson for the suggestion.)

    Support for floating-point time_t has been removed.
    It was always dicey, and POSIX no longer requires it.
    (Thanks to Eric Blake for suggesting to the POSIX committee to
    remove it, and thanks to Alan Barrett, Clive D.W. Feather, Andy
    Heninger, Arthur David Olson, and Alois Treindl, for reporting
    bugs and elucidating some of the corners of the old floating-point
    implementation.)

    The signatures of 'offtime', 'timeoff', and 'gtime' have been
    changed back to the old practice of using 'long' to represent UT
    offsets.  This had been inadvertently and mistakenly changed to
    'int_fast32_t'.  (Thanks to Christos Zoulas.)

    The code avoids undefined behavior on integer overflow in some
    more places, including gmtime, localtime, mktime and zdump.

  Changes affecting the zdump utility

    zdump now outputs "UT" when referring to Universal Time, not "UTC".
    "UTC" does not make sense for timestamps that predate the introduction
    of UTC, whereas "UT", a more generic term, does.  (Thanks to Steve Allen
    for clarifying UT vs UTC.)

  Data changes affecting behavior of tzselect and similar programs

    Country code BQ is now called the more common name "Caribbean Netherlands"
    rather than the more official "Bonaire, St Eustatius & Saba".

    Remove from zone.tab the names America/Montreal, America/Shiprock,
    and Antarctica/South_Pole, as they are equivalent to existing
    same-country-code zones for post-1970 timestamps.  The data entries for
    these names are unchanged, so the names continue to work as before.

  Changes affecting code internals

    zic -c now runs way faster on 64-bit hosts when given large numbers.

    zic now uses vfprintf to avoid allocating and freeing some memory.

    tzselect now computes the list of continents from the data,
    rather than have it hard-coded.

    Minor changes pacify GCC 4.7.3 and GCC 4.8.1.

  Changes affecting the build procedure

    The 'leapseconds' file is now generated automatically from a
    new file 'leap-seconds.list', which is a copy of
    <ftp://ftp.nist.gov/pub/time/leap-seconds.list>
    A new source file 'leapseconds.awk' implements this.
    The goal is simplification of the future maintenance of 'leapseconds'.

    When building the 'posix' or 'right' subdirectories, if the
    subdirectory would be a copy of the default subdirectory, it is
    now made a symbolic link if that is supported.  This saves about
    2 MB of file system space.

    The links America/Shiprock and Antarctica/South_Pole have been
    moved to the 'backward' file.  This affects only nondefault builds
    that omit 'backward'.

  Changes affecting version-control only

    .gitignore now ignores 'date'.

  Changes affecting documentation and commentary

    Changes to the 'tzfile' man page

      It now mentions that the binary file format may be extended in
      future versions by appending data.

      It now refers to the 'zdump' and 'zic' man pages.

    Changes to the 'zic' man page

      It lists conditions that elicit a warning with '-v'.

      It says that the behavior is unspecified when duplicate names
      are given, or if the source of one link is the target of another.

      Its examples are updated to match the latest data.

      The definition of white space has been clarified slightly.
      (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)

    Changes to the 'Theory' file

      There is a new section about the accuracy of the tz database,
      describing the many ways that errors can creep in, and
      explaining why so many of the pre-1970 timestamps are wrong or
      misleading (thanks to Steve Allen, Lester Caine, and Garrett
      Wollman for discussions that contributed to this).

      The 'Theory' file describes LMT better (this follows a
      suggestion by Guy Harris).

      It refers to the 2013 edition of POSIX rather than the 2004 edition.

      It's mentioned that excluding 'backward' should not affect the
      other data, and it suggests at least one zone.tab name per
      inhabited country (thanks to Stephen Colebourne).

      Some longstanding restrictions on names are documented, e.g.,
      'America/New_York' precludes 'America/New_York/Bronx'.

      It gives more reasons for the 1970 cutoff.

      It now mentions which time_t variants are supported, such as
      signed integer time_t.  (Thanks to Paul Goyette for reporting
      typos in an experimental version of this change.)

      (Thanks to Philip Newton for correcting typos in these changes.)

    Documentation and commentary is more careful to distinguish UT in
    general from UTC in particular.  (Thanks to Steve Allen.)

    Add a better source for the Zurich 1894 transition.
    (Thanks to Pierre-Yves Berger.)

    Update shapefile citations in tz-link.htm.  (Thanks to Guy Harris.)


Release 2013d - 2013-07-05 07:38:01 -0700

  Changes affecting future timestamps:

    Morocco's midsummer transitions this year are July 7 and August 10,
    not July 9 and August 8.  (Thanks to Andrew Paprocki.)

    Israel now falls back on the last Sunday of October.
    (Thanks to Ephraim Silverberg.)

  Changes affecting past timestamps:

    Specify Jerusalem's location more precisely; this changes the pre-1880
    times by 2 s.

  Changing affecting metadata only:

    Fix typos in the entries for country codes BQ and SX.

  Changes affecting code:

    Rework the code to fix a bug with handling Australia/Macquarie on
    32-bit hosts (thanks to Arthur David Olson).

    Port to platforms like NetBSD, where time_t can be wider than long.

    Add support for testing time_t types other than the system's.
    Run 'make check_time_t_alternatives' to try this out.
    Currently, the tests fail for unsigned time_t;
    this should get fixed at some point.

  Changes affecting documentation and commentary:

    Deemphasize the significance of national borders.

    Update the zdump man page.

    Remove obsolete NOID comment (thanks to Denis Excoffier).

    Update several URLs and comments in the web pages.

    Spelling fixes (thanks to Kevin Lyda and Jonathan Leffler).

    Update URL for CLDR Zone->Tzid table (thanks to Yoshito Umaoka).


Release 2013c - 2013-04-19 16:17:40 -0700

  Changes affecting current and future timestamps:

    Palestine observed DST starting March 29, 2013.  (Thanks to
    Steffen Thorsen.)  From 2013 on, Gaza and Hebron both observe DST,
    with the predicted rules being the last Thursday in March at 24:00
    to the first Friday on or after September 21 at 01:00.

    Assume that the recent change to Paraguay's DST rules is permanent,
    by moving the end of DST to the 4th Sunday in March every year.
    (Thanks to Carlos Raúl Perasso.)

  Changes affecting past timestamps:

    Fix some historical data for Palestine to agree with that of
    timeanddate.com, as follows:

	  The spring 2008 change in Gaza and Hebron was on 00:00 Mar 28, not
	  00:00 Apr 1.

	  The fall 2009 change in Gaza and Hebron on Sep 4 was at 01:00, not
	  02:00.

	  The spring 2010 change in Hebron was 00:00 Mar 26, not 00:01 Mar 27.

	  The spring 2011 change in Gaza was 00:01 Apr 1, not 12:01 Apr 2.

	  The spring 2011 change in Hebron on Apr 1 was at 00:01, not 12:01.

	  The fall 2011 change in Hebron on Sep 30 was at 00:00, not 03:00.

    Fix times of habitation for Macquarie to agree with the Tasmania
    Parks & Wildlife Service history, which indicates that permanent
    habitation was 1899-1919 and 1948 on.

  Changing affecting metadata only:

    Macquarie Island is politically part of Australia, not Antarctica.
    (Thanks to Tobias Conradi.)

    Sort Macquarie more consistently with other parts of Australia.
    (Thanks to Tim Parenti.)


Release 2013b - 2013-03-10 22:33:40 -0700

  Changes affecting current and future timestamps:

    Haiti uses US daylight-saving rules this year, and presumably future years.
    This changes timestamps starting today.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

    Paraguay will end DST on March 24 this year.
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)  For now, assume it's just this year.

    Morocco does not observe DST during Ramadan;
    try to predict Ramadan in Morocco as best we can.
    (Thanks to Erik Homoet for the heads-up.)

  Changes affecting commentary:

    Update URLs in tz-link page.  Add URLs for webOS, BB10, iOS.
    Update URL for Solaris.  Mention Internet RFC 6557.
    Update Internet RFCs 2445->5545, 2822->5322.
    Switch from FTP to HTTP for Internet RFCs.


Release 2013a - 2013-02-27 09:20:35 -0800

  Change affecting binary data format:

    The zone offset at the end of version-2-format zone files is now
    allowed to be 24:00, as per POSIX.1-2008.  (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)

  Changes affecting current and future timestamps:

    Chile's 2013 rules, and we guess rules for 2014 and later, will be
    the same as 2012, namely Apr Sun>=23 03:00 UTC to Sep Sun>=2 04:00 UTC.
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen and Robert Elz.)

    New Zones Asia/Khandyga, Asia/Ust-Nera, Europe/Busingen.
    (Thanks to Tobias Conradi and Arthur David Olson.)

  Many changes affect historical timestamps before 1940.
  These were deduced from: Milne J. Civil time. Geogr J. 1899
  Feb;13(2):173-94 <https://www.jstor.org/stable/1774359>.

  Changes affecting the code:

    Fix zic bug that mishandled Egypt's 2010 changes (this also affected
    the data).  (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)

    Fix localtime bug when time_t is unsigned and data files were generated
    by a signed time_t system.  (Thanks to Doug Bailey for reporting and
    to Arthur David Olson for fixing.)

    Allow the email address for bug reports to be set by the packager.
    The default is tz@iana.org, as before.  (Thanks to Joseph S. Myers.)

    Update HTML checking to be compatible with Ubuntu 12.10.

    Check that files are a safe subset of ASCII.  At some point we may
    relax this requirement to a safe subset of UTF-8.  Without the
    check, some non-UTF-8 encodings were leaking into the distribution.

  Commentary changes:

    Restore a comment about copyright notices that was inadvertently deleted.
    (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)

    Improve the commentary about which districts observe what times
    in Russia.  (Thanks to Oscar van Vlijmen and Arthur David Olson.)

    Add web page links to tz.js.

    Add "Run by the Monkeys" to tz-art.  (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)


Release 2012j - 2012-11-12 18:34:49 -0800

  Libya moved to CET this weekend, but with DST planned next year.
  (Thanks to Even Scharning, Steffen Thorsen, and Tim Parenti.)

  Signatures now have the extension .asc, not .sign, as that's more
  standard.  (Thanks to Phil Pennock.)

  The output of 'zdump --version', and of 'zic --version', now
  uses a format that is more typical for --version.
  (Thanks to Joseph S. Myers.)

  The output of 'tzselect --help', 'zdump --help', and 'zic --help'
  now uses tz@iana.org rather than the old elsie address.

  zic -v now complains about abbreviations that are less than 3
  or more than 6 characters, as per Posix.  Formerly, it checked
  for abbreviations that were more than 3.

  'make public' no longer puts its temporary directory under /tmp,
  and uses the just-built zic rather than the system zic.

  Various fixes to documentation and commentary.


Release 2012i - 2012-11-03 12:57:09 -0700

  Cuba switches from DST tomorrow at 01:00.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Linker flags can now be specified via LDFLAGS.
  AWK now defaults to 'awk', not 'nawk'.
  The shell in tzselect now defaults to /bin/bash, but this can
  be overridden by specifying KSHELL.
  The main web page now mentions the unofficial GitHub repository.
  (Thanks to Mike Frysinger.)

  Tarball signatures can now be built by running 'make signatures'.
  There are also new makefile rules 'tarballs', 'check_public', and
  separate makefile rules for each tarball and signature file.
  A few makefile rules are now more portable to strict POSIX.

  The main web page now lists the canonical IANA URL.


Release 2012h - 2012-10-26 22:49:10 -0700

  Bahia no longer has DST.  (Thanks to Kelley Cook.)

  Tocantins has DST.  (Thanks to Rodrigo Severo.)

  Israel has new DST rules next year.  (Thanks to Ephraim Silverberg.)

  Jordan stays on DST this winter.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Web page updates.

  More C modernization, except that at Arthur David Olson's suggestion
  the instances of 'register' were kept.


Release 2012g - 2012-10-17 20:59:45 -0700

  Samoa fall 2012 and later.  (Thanks to Nicholas Pereira and Robert Elz.)

  Palestine fall 2012.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  Assume C89.

  To attack the version-number problem, this release ships the file
  'Makefile' (which contains the release number) in both the tzcode and
  the tzdata tarballs.  The two Makefiles are identical, and should be
  identical in any matching pair of tarballs, so it shouldn't matter
  which order you extract the tarballs.  Perhaps we can come up with a
  better version-number scheme at some point; this scheme does have the
  virtue of not adding more files.


Release 2012f - 2012-09-12 23:17:03 -0700

  * australasia (Pacific/Fiji): Fiji DST is October 21 through January
    20 this year.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)


Release 2012e - 2012-08-02 20:44:55 -0700

  * australasia (Pacific/Fakaofo): Tokelau is UT +13, not +14.
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)

  * Use a single version number for both code and data.

  * .gitignore: New file.

  * Remove trailing white space.


Release code2012c-data2012d - 2012-07-19 16:35:33 -0700

  Changes for Morocco's timestamps, which take effect in a couple of
  hours, along with infrastructure changes to accommodate how the tz
  code and data are released on IANA.


Release data2012c - 2012-03-27 12:17:25 -0400

  africa
	Summer time changes for Morocco (to start late April 2012)

  asia
	Changes for 2012 for Gaza & the West Bank (Hebron) and Syria

  northamerica
	Haiti following US/Canada rules for 2012 (and we're assuming,
	for now anyway, for the future).


Release 2012b - 2012-03-02 12:29:15 +0700

  There is just one change to tzcode2012b (compared with 2012a):
  the Makefile that was accidentally included with 2012a has been
  replaced with the version that should have been there, which is
  identical with the previous version (from tzcode2011i).

  There are just two changes in tzdata2012b compared with 2012a.

  Most significantly, summer time in Cuba has been delayed 3 weeks
  (now starts April 1 rather than March 11).   Since Mar 11 (the old start
  date, as listed in 2012a) is just a little over a week away, this
  change is urgent.

  Less importantly, an excess tab in one of the changes in zone.tab
  in 2012a has been removed.


Release 2012a - 2012-03-01 18:28:10 +0700

  The changes in tzcode2012a (compared to the previous version, 2011i)
  are entirely to the README and tz-art.htm and tz-link.htm files, if
  none of those concern you, you can ignore the code update.  The changes
  reflect the changed addresses for the mailing list and the code and
  data distribution points & methods (and a link to DateTime::TimeZone::Tzfile
  has been added to tz-link.htm).

  In tzdata2012a (compared to the previous release, which was 2011n)
  the major changes are:
	Chile 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 summer time date adjustments.
	Falkland Islands onto permanent summer time (we're assuming for the
		foreseeable future, though 2012 is all we're fairly certain of.)
	Armenia has abolished Summer Time.
	Tokelau jumped the International Date Line back last December
		(just the same as their near neighbour, Samoa).
	America/Creston is a new zone for a small area of British Columbia
	There will be a leapsecond 2012-06-30 23:59:60 UTC.

  Other minor changes are:
	Corrections to 1918 Canadian summer time end dates.
	Updated URL for UK time zone history (in comments)
	A few typos in Le Corre's list of free French place names (comments)


Release data2011n - 2011-10-30 14:57:54 +0700

  There are three changes of note - most urgently, Cuba (America/Havana)
  has extended summer time by two weeks, now to end on Nov 13, rather than
  the (already past) Oct 30.   Second, the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic
  (Europe/Tiraspol) decided not to split from the rest of Moldova after
  all, and consequently that zone has been removed (again) and reinstated
  in the "backward" file as a link to Europe/Chisinau.   And third, the
  end date for Fiji's summer time this summer was moved forward from the
  earlier planned Feb 26, to Jan 22.

  Apart from that, Moldova (MD) returns to a single entry in zone.tab
  (and the incorrect syntax that was in the 2011m version of that file
  is so fixed - it would have been fixed in a different way had this
  change not happened - that's the "missing" sccs version id).


Release data2011m - 2011-10-24 21:42:16 +0700

  In particular, the typos in comments in the data (2011-11-17 should have
  been 2011-10-17 as Alan Barrett noted, and spelling of Tiraspol that
  Tim Parenti noted) have been fixed, and the change for Ukraine has been
  made in all 4 Ukrainian zones, rather than just Kiev (again, thanks to
  Tim Parenti, and also Denys Gavrysh)

  In addition, I added Europe/Tiraspol to zone.tab.

  This time, all the files have new version numbers...  (including the files
  otherwise unchanged in 2011m that were changed in 2011l but didn't get new
  version numbers there...)


Release data2011l - 2011-10-10 11:15:43 +0700

  There are just 2 changes that cause different generated tzdata files from
  zic, to Asia/Hebron and Pacific/Fiji - the possible change for Bahia, Brazil
  is included, but commented out.  Compared with the diff I sent out last week,
  this version also includes attributions for the sources for the changes
  (in much the same format as ado used, but the html tags have not been
  checked, verified, or used in any way at all, so if there are errors there,
  please let me know.)

  zic/multiprocessor/directory-creation situation.


Release 1997a - 1997-01-21 09:11:10 -0500

  Paul Eggert's Antarctica (and other changes)

  Arthur David Olson finessed the "getopt" issue by checking against
  both -1 and EOF (regardless of POSIX, SunOS 4.1.1's manual says -1
  is returned while SunOS 5.5's manual says EOF is returned).


Release code1996o-data1996n - 1996-12-27 21:42:05 -0500

  Paul Eggert's latest changes


Release code1996n - 1996-12-16 09:42:02 -0500

  link snapping fix from Bruce Evans (via Garrett Wollman)


Release data1996m - 1996-11-24 02:37:34 -0000

  Paul Eggert's batch of changes


Release code1996m-data1996l - 1996-11-05 14:00:12 -0500

  No functional changes here; the files have simply been changed to
  make more use of ISO style dates in comments. The names of the above
  files now include the year in full.


Release code96l - 1996-09-08 17:12:20 -0400

  tzcode96k was missing a couple of pieces.

  Paul's suggested patch for strftime %V week numbers


Release data96i - 1996-07-01 18:13:04 -0400

  "northamerica" and "europe" changes by Paul Eggert


Release code96h - 1996-06-05 08:02:21 -0400

  fix for handling transitions specified in Universal Time

  Some "public domain" notices have also been added.


Release code96g - 1996-05-16 14:00:26 -0400

  fix for the simultaneous-DST-and-zone-change challenge


Release data96h - 1996-05-09 17:40:51 -0400

  changes by Paul Eggert


Release code96f-data96g - 1996-05-03 03:09:59 -0000
  [tzcode96f.tar.gz + tzdata96g.tar.gz are both missing!]

  The changes get us some of the way to fixing the problems noted in Paul
  Eggert's letter yesterday (in addition to a few others).  The approach
  has been to make zic a bit smarter about figuring out what time zone
  abbreviations apply just after the time specified in the "UNTIL" part
  of a zone line.  Putting the smarts in zic means avoiding having
  transition times show up in both "Zone" lines and "Rule" lines, which
  in turn avoids multiple transition time entries in time zone files.
  (This also makes the zic input files such as "europe" a bit shorter and
  should ease maintenance.)


Release data96f - 1996-04-19 19:20:03 -0000
  [tzdata96f.tar.gz is missing!]

  The only changes are to the "northamerica" file; the time zone
  abbreviation for Denver is corrected to MST (and MDT), and the
  comments for Mexico have been updated.


Release data96e - 1996-03-19 17:37:26 -0500

  Proposals by Paul Eggert, in particular the Portugal change that
  comes into play at the end of this month.

  command.


Release 96a - 1996-01-06 09:08:24 -0500

  Israel updates

  fixes to strftime.c for correct ISO 8601 week number generation,
  plus support for two new formats ('G' and 'g') to give ISO 8601 year
  numbers (which are not necessarily the same as calendar year numbers)

  The latest revisions from Paul Eggert are included, the usno1995
  file has been updated, and a new file ("WWW") covering useful URLs
  has been added.


Release code95h-data95l - 1995-12-19 18:10:12 -0500

  A simplification of a macro definition, a change to data for Sudan,
  and (for last minute shoppers) notes in the "Music" file on the CD
  "Old Man Time".


Release code95g-data95k - 1995-10-30 10:32:47 -0500

  (slightly reformatted) 8-bit-clean proposed patch

  minor patch: US/Eastern -> America/New_York

  snapshot of the USNO's latest data ("usno1995")

  some other minor cleanups


Release code95f-data95j - 1995-10-28 21:01:34 -0000

  European cleanups

  support for 64-bit time_t's

  optimization in localtime.c


Release code95e - 1995-10-13 13:23:57 -0400

  the mktime change to scan from future to past when trying to find time zone
  offsets


Release data95i - 1995-09-26 10:43:26 -0400

  For Canada/Central, guess that the Sun customer's "one week too
  early" was just a approximation, and the true error is one month
  too early.  This is consistent with the rest of Canada.


Release data95h - 1995-09-21 11:26:48 -0400

  latest changes from Paul Eggert


Release code95d - 1995-09-14 11:14:45 -0400

  Paul Eggert's change to the australasia file


Release data95e - 1995-07-08 18:02:34 -0400

  The only change is a leap second at the end of this year.
  Thanks to Bradley White for forwarding news on the leap second.


Release data95d - 1995-07-03 13:26:22 -0400

  Paul Eggert's changes


Release data95c - 1995-07-02 19:19:28 -0400

  changes to "asia", "backward", "europe", and "southamerica"
  (read: northamericacentrics need not apply)


Release code95c - 1995-03-13 14:00:46 -0500

  one-line fix for sign extension problems in detzcode


Release 95b - 1995-03-04 11:22:38 -0500

  Minor changes in both:

  The "code" file contains a workaround for the lack of "unistd.h" in
  Microsoft C++ version 7.

  The "data" file contains a fixed "Link" for America/Shiprock.


Release 94h - 1994-12-10 12:51:14 -0500

  The files:

  *	incorporate the changes to "zdump" and "date" to make changes to
	the "TZ" environment variable permanent;

  *	incorporate the table changes by Paul Eggert;

  *	include (and document) support for universal time specifications in
	data files - but do not (yet) include use of this feature in the
	data files.

  Think of this as "TZ Classic" - the software has been set up not to break if
  universal time shows up in its input, and data entries have been
  left as is so as not to break existing implementations.


Release data94f - 1994-08-20 12:56:09 -0400

  (with thanks!) the latest data updates from Paul Eggert


Release data94e - 1994-06-04 13:13:53 -0400

Release code94f - 1994-05-05 13:00:33 -0000
  [tzcode94f.tar.gz is missing!]

  changes to avoid overflow in difftime, as well as changes to cope
  with the 52/53 challenge in strftime


Release code94e - 1994-03-30 23:32:59 -0500

  change for the benefit of PCTS


Release 94d - 1994-02-24 15:42:25 -0500

  Avoid clashes with POSIX semantics for zones such as GMT+4.

  Some other very minor housekeeping is also present.


Release code94c - 1994-02-10 08:52:40 -0500

  Fix bug where mkdirs was broken unless you compile with
  -fwritable-strings (which is generally losing to do).


Release 94b - 1994-02-07 10:04:33 -0500

  work by Paul Eggert who notes:

  I found another book of time zone histories by E W Whitman; it's not
  as extensive as Shanks but has a few goodies of its own.  I used it
  to update the tables.  I also fixed some more as a result of
  correspondence with Adam David and Peter Ilieve, and move some stray
  links from 'europe' to 'backward'.  I corrected some scanning errors
  in usno1989.

  As far as the code goes, I fixed zic to allow years in the range
  INT_MIN to INT_MAX; this fixed a few boundary conditions around 1900.
  And I cleaned up the zic documentation a little bit.


Release data94a - 1994-02-03 08:58:54 -0500

  It simply incorporates the recently announced leap second into the
  "leapseconds" file.


Release 93g - 1993-11-22 17:28:27 -0500

  Paul Eggert has provided a good deal of historic information (based
  on Shanks), and there are some code changes to deal with the buglets
  that crawled out in dealing with the new information.


Release 93f - 1993-10-15 12:27:46 -0400

  Paul Eggert's changes


Release 93e - 1993-09-05 21:21:44 -0400

  This has updated data for Israel, England, and Kwajalein.  There's
  also an update to "zdump" to cope with Kwajalein's 24-hour jump.
  Thanks to Paul Eggert and Peter Ilieve for the changes.


Release 93d - 1993-06-17 23:34:17 -0400

  new fix and new data on Israel


Release 93c - 1993-06-06 19:31:55 -0400

  [not summarized]


Release 93b - 1993-02-02 14:53:58 -0500

  updated "leapseconds" file


Release 93 - 1993-01-08 07:01:06 -0500

  At kre's suggestion, the package has been split in two - a code piece
  (which also includes documentation) that's only of use to folks who
  want to recompile things and a data piece useful to anyone who can
  run "zic".

  The new version has a few changes to the data files, a few
  portability changes, and an off-by-one fix (with thanks to
  Tom Karzes at deshaw.com for providing a description and a
  solution).


Release 92c - 1992-11-21 17:35:36 -0000
  [tz92c.tar.Z is missing!]

  The fallout from the latest round of DST transitions.

  There are changes for Portugal, Saskatchewan, and "Pacific-New";
  there's also a change to "zic.c" that makes it portable to more systems.


Release 92 - 1992-04-25 18:17:03 -0000
  [tz92.tar.Z is missing!]

  By popular demand (well, at any rate, following a request by kre at munnari)


The 1989 update of the time zone package featured:

  *	POSIXization (including interpretation of POSIX-style TZ environment
	variables, provided by Guy Harris),
  *	ANSIfication (including versions of "mktime" and "difftime"),
  *	SVIDulation (an "altzone" variable)
  *	MACHination (the "gtime" function)
  *	corrections to some time zone data (including corrections to the rules
	for Great Britain and New Zealand)
  *	reference data from the United States Naval Observatory for folks who
	want to do additional time zones
  *	and the 1989 data for Saudi Arabia.

  (Since this code will be treated as "part of the implementation" in some
  places and as "part of the application" in others, there's no good way to
  name functions, such as timegm, that are not part of the proposed ANSI C
  standard; such functions have kept their old, underscore-free names in this
  update.)

  And the "dysize" function has disappeared; it was present to allow
  compilation of the "date" command on old BSD systems, and a version of "date"
  is now provided in the package.  The "date" command is not created when you
  "make all" since it may lack options provided by the version distributed with
  your operating system, or may not interact with the system in the same way
  the native version does.

  Since POSIX frowns on correct leap second handling, the default behavior of
  the "zic" command (in the absence of a "-L" option) has been changed to omit
  leap second information from its output files.

Notes

This file contains copies of the part of each release announcement
that talks about the changes in that release.  The text has been
adapted and reformatted for the purposes of this file.

Traditionally a release R consists of a pair of tarball files,
tzcodeR.tar.gz and tzdataR.tar.gz.  However, some releases (e.g.,
code2010a, data2012c) consist of just one or the other tarball, and a
few (e.g., code2012c-data2012d) have tarballs with mixed version
numbers.  Recent releases also come in an experimental format
consisting of a single tarball tzdb-R.tar.lz with extra data.

Release timestamps are taken from the release's commit (for newer,
Git-based releases), from the newest file in the tarball (for older
releases, where this info is available) or from the email announcing
the release (if all else fails; these are marked with a time zone
abbreviation of -0000 and an "is missing!" comment).

Earlier versions of the code and data were not announced on the tz
list and are not summarized here.

This file is in the public domain.

					(from the Bell System film "About Time")

The Time Zone Database (called tz, tzdb or zoneinfo) contains code and
data that represent the history of local time for many representative
locations around the globe.  It is updated periodically to reflect
changes made by political bodies to time zone boundaries, UTC offsets,
and daylight-saving rules.

See <https://www.iana.org/time-zones/repository/tz-link.html> or the
file tz-link.html for how to acquire the code and data.  Once acquired,
read the comments in the file 'Makefile' and make any changes needed
to make things right for your system, especially if you are using some
platform other than GNU/Linux.  Then run the following commands,
substituting your desired installation directory for "$HOME/tzdir":

	make TOPDIR=$HOME/tzdir install
	$HOME/tzdir/usr/bin/zdump -v America/Los_Angeles

See the file tz-how-to.html for examples of how to read the data files.

This database of historical local time information has several goals:

 * Provide a compendium of data about the history of civil time that
   is useful even if not 100% accurate.

 * Give an idea of the variety of local time rules that have existed
   in the past and thus may be expected in the future.

 * Test the generality of the local time rule description system.

The information in the time zone data files is by no means authoritative;
fixes and enhancements are welcome.  Please see the file CONTRIBUTING
for details.

Thanks to these Time Zone Caballeros who've made major contributions to the
time conversion package: Keith Bostic; Bob Devine; Paul Eggert; Robert Elz;
Guy Harris; Mark Horton; John Mackin; and Bradley White.  Thanks also to
Michael Bloom, Art Neilson, Stephen Prince, John Sovereign, and Frank Wales
for testing work, and to Gwillim Law for checking local mean time data.
Thanks in particular to Arthur David Olson, the project's founder and first
maintainer, to whom the time zone community owes the greatest debt of all.
None of them are responsible for remaining errors.

# From Paul Eggert (2018-05-27):
#
# Unless otherwise specified, the source for data through 1990 is:
# Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
# Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.
#
# Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source
# for time zone data was the International Air Transport
# Association's Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
# published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
# of the IATA's data after 1990.  Except where otherwise noted,
# IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
#
# Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
# Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
# I found in the UCLA library.
#
# For data circa 1899, a common source is:
# Milne J. Civil time. Geogr J. 1899 Feb;13(2):173-94.
# https://www.jstor.org/stable/1774359
#
# European-style abbreviations are commonly used along the Mediterranean.
# For sub-Saharan Africa abbreviations were less standardized.
# Previous editions of this database used WAT, CAT, SAT, and EAT
# for UT +00 through +03, respectively,
# but in 1997 Mark R V Murray reported that
# 'SAST' is the official abbreviation for +02 in the country of South Africa,
# 'CAT' is commonly used for +02 in countries north of South Africa, and
# 'WAT' is probably the best name for +01, as the common phrase for
# the area that includes Nigeria is "West Africa".
#
# To summarize, the following abbreviations seemed to have some currency:
#	 +00	GMT	Greenwich Mean Time
#	 +02	CAT	Central Africa Time
#	 +02	SAST	South Africa Standard Time
# and Murray suggested the following abbreviation:
#	 +01	WAT	West Africa Time
# Murray's suggestion seems to have caught on in news reports and the like.
# I vaguely recall 'WAT' also being used for -01 in the past but
# cannot now come up with solid citations.
#
# I invented the following abbreviations in the 1990s:
#	 +02	WAST	West Africa Summer Time
#	 +03	CAST	Central Africa Summer Time
#	 +03	SAST	South Africa Summer Time
#	 +03	EAT	East Africa Time
# 'EAT' seems to have caught on and is in current timestamps, and though
# the other abbreviations are rarer and are only in past timestamps,
# they are paired with better-attested non-DST abbreviations.
# Corrections are welcome.

# From Abdelrahman Hassan (2007-09-06):
# Due to the Hijri (lunar Islamic calendar) year being 11 days shorter
# than the year of the Gregorian calendar, Ramadan shifts earlier each
# year. This year it will be observed September 13 (September is quite
# hot in Egypt), and the idea is to make fasting easier for workers by
# shifting business hours one hour out of daytime heat. Consequently,
# unless discontinued, next DST may end Thursday 28 August 2008.
# From Paul Eggert (2007-08-17):
# For lack of better info, assume the new rule is last Thursday in August.

# From Paul Eggert (2017-03-02):
#
# The Nautical Almanac for the Year 1970, p 264, is the source for -0:44:30.
#
# In 1972 Liberia was the last country to switch from a UT offset
# that was not a multiple of 15 or 20 minutes.  The 1972 change was on
# 1972-01-07, according to an entry dated 1972-01-04 on p 330 of:
# Presidential Papers: First year of the administration of
# President William R. Tolbert, Jr., July 23, 1971-July 31, 1972.
# Monrovia: Executive Mansion.
#
# Use the abbreviation "MMT" before 1972, as the more accurate numeric
# abbreviation "-004430" would be one byte over the POSIX limit.

# Mauritius

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-06-25):
# Mauritius plans to observe DST from 2008-11-01 to 2009-03-31 on a trial
# basis....
# It seems that Mauritius observed daylight saving time from 1982-10-10 to
# 1983-03-20 as well, but that was not successful....
# https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/mauritius-daylight-saving-time.html

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-06-25):
# http://economicdevelopment.gov.mu/portal/site/Mainhomepage/menuitem.a42b24128104d9845dabddd154508a0c/?content_id=0a7cee8b5d69a110VgnVCM1000000a04a8c0RCRD

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-06-30):
# The www.timeanddate.com article cited by Steffen Thorsen notes that "A
# final decision has yet to be made on the times that daylight saving
# would begin and end on these dates." As a place holder, use midnight.

# From Paul Eggert (2008-06-30):
# Follow Thorsen on DST in 1982/1983, instead of Shanks & Pottenger.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-07-10):
# According to
# http://www.lexpress.mu/display_article.php?news_id=111216
# (in French), Mauritius will start and end their DST a few days earlier
# than previously announced (2008-11-01 to 2009-03-31).  The new start
# date is 2008-10-26 at 02:00 and the new end date is 2009-03-27 (no time
# given, but it is probably at either 2 or 3 wall clock time).
#
# A little strange though, since the article says that they moved the date
# to align itself with Europe and USA which also change time on that date,
# but that means they have not paid attention to what happened in
# USA/Canada last year (DST ends first Sunday in November). I also wonder
# why that they end on a Friday, instead of aligning with Europe which
# changes two days later.

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-07-11):
# Seems that English language article "The revival of daylight saving
# time: Energy conservation?"- No. 16578 (07/11/2008) was originally
# published on Monday, June 30, 2008...
#
# I guess that article in French "Le gouvernement avance l'introduction
# de l'heure d'été" stating that DST in Mauritius starting on October 26
# and ending on March 27, 2009 is the most recent one....

# Cabinet Decision of July 18th, 2008 states as follows:

# the standard time, will be aligned with that in Europe and the United
# States of America. It will start at two o'clock in the morning on the
# last Sunday of October and will end at two o'clock in the morning on
# the last Sunday of March the following year. The summer time for the
# year 2008-2009 will, therefore, be effective as from 26 October 2008

# From Milamber (2020-05-31)
# In Morocco (where I live), the end of Ramadan (Arabic month) is followed by
# the Eid al-Fitr, and concretely it's 1 or 2 day offs for the people (with
# traditional visiting of family, big lunches/dinners, etc.).  So for this
# year the astronomical calculations don't include the following 2 days off in
# the calc.  These 2 days fall in a Sunday/Monday, so it's not acceptable by
# people to have a time shift during these 2 days off.  Perhaps you can modify
# the (predicted) rules for next years: if the end of Ramadan is a (probable)
# Friday or Saturday (and so the 2 days off are on a weekend), the next time
# shift will be the next weekend.

# For now, guess that in the future Morocco will fall back at 03:00
# the last Sunday before Ramadan, and spring forward at 02:00 the
# first Sunday after one day after Ramadan.  To implement this,
# transition dates and times for 2019 through 2087 were determined by
# running the following program under GNU Emacs 28.2.  (This algorithm
# also produces the correct transition dates for 2016 through 2018,
# though the times differ due to Morocco's time zone change in 2018.)
# (let ((islamic-year 1440))
#   (require 'cal-islam)
#   (while (< islamic-year 1511)
#     (let ((a (calendar-islamic-to-absolute (list 9 1 islamic-year)))
#           (b (+ 1 (calendar-islamic-to-absolute (list 10 1 islamic-year))))
#           (sunday 0))
#       (while (/= sunday (mod (setq a (1- a)) 7)))
#       (while (/= sunday (mod b 7))
#         (setq b (1+ b)))
#       (setq a (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute a))
#       (setq b (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute b))
#       (insert
#        (format
#         (concat "Rule\tMorocco\t%d\tonly\t-\t%s\t%2d\t 3:00\t-1:00\t-\n"
#                 "Rule\tMorocco\t%d\tonly\t-\t%s\t%2d\t 2:00\t0\t-\n")
#         (car (cdr (cdr a))) (calendar-month-name (car a) t) (car (cdr a))
#         (car (cdr (cdr b))) (calendar-month-name (car b) t) (car (cdr b)))))
#     (setq islamic-year (+ 1 islamic-year))))

# Namibia

# From Arthur David Olson (2017-08-09):
# The text of the "Namibia Time Act, 1994" is available online at
# www.lac.org.na/laws/1994/811.pdf
# and includes this nugget:
# Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2) of section 1, the
# first winter period after the commencement of this Act shall
# commence at OOhOO on Monday 21 March 1994 and shall end at 02h00 on
# Sunday 4 September 1994.

# From Michael Deckers (2017-04-06):
# ... both summer and winter time are called "standard"
# (which differs from the use in Ireland) ...

# From Petronella Sibeene (2007-03-30):
# http://allafrica.com/stories/200703300178.html
# While the entire country changes its time, Katima Mulilo and other
# settlements in Caprivi unofficially will not because the sun there
# rises and sets earlier compared to other regions.  Chief of
# Forecasting Riaan van Zyl explained that the far eastern parts of
# the country are close to 40 minutes earlier in sunrise than the rest
# of the country.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-02-22):
# Although the Zambezi Region (formerly known as Caprivi) informally
# observes Botswana time, we have no details about historical practice.
# In the meantime people there can use Africa/Gaborone.
# See: Immanuel S. The Namibian. 2017-02-23.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2017-08-09):
# Namibia is going to change their time zone to what is now their DST:
# https://www.newera.com.na/2017/02/23/namibias-winter-time-might-be-repealed/
# This video is from the government decision:
# https://www.nbc.na/news/na-passes-namibia-time-bill-repealing-1994-namibia-time-act.8665
# We have made the assumption so far that they will change their time zone at
# the same time they would normally start DST, the first Sunday in September:
# https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/namibia-new-time-zone.html

# From Paul Eggert (2017-04-09):
# Before the change, summer and winter time were both standard time legally.
# However in common parlance, winter time was considered to be DST.  See, e.g.:
# http://www.nbc.na/news/namibias-winter-time-could-be-scrapped.2706
# https://zone.my.na/news/times-are-changing-in-namibia
# https://www.newera.com.na/2017/02/23/namibias-winter-time-might-be-repealed/

# http://ddsnext.crl.edu/titles/31558#?c=0&m=668&s=0&cv=2&r=0&xywh=1446,5221,1931,1235
# says "It is officially notified that on and after the 1st of July 1905
# Greenwich Mean Solar Time will be adopted throughout the Colony and

#
# It seemed that Lagos returned to LMT on 1908-07-01.

#
# From P Chan (2020-11-27):
# On 1914-01-01, standard time of GMT+0:30 was adopted for the unified Nigeria.

# "On January 1st [1914], a universal standard time for Nigeria was adopted,
# viz., half an hour fast on Greenwich mean time, corresponding to the meridian
# 7° 30' E. long."
# Lloyd's Register of Shipping (1915) says "Hitherto the time observed in Lagos
# was the local mean time. On 1st January, 1914, standard time for the whole of
# Nigeria was introduced ... Lagos time has been advanced about 16 minutes
# accordingly."
#
# In 1919, standard time was changed to GMT+1.

# "The expression 'Standard time' means standard time as used in Nigeria:
# namely, 60 minutes in advance of Greenwich mean time.  (As amended by 18 of
# 1919, s. 2.)"
# From Tim Parenti (2020-12-10):
# The Lagos Weekly Record, 1919-09-20, p 3 details discussion on the first

# "The proposal is that the Globe should be divided into twelve zones East and
# West of Greenwich, of one hour each, Nigeria falling into the zone with a
# standard of one hour fast on Greenwich Mean Time.  Nigeria standard time is
# now 30 minutes in advance of Greenwich Mean Time ... according to the new
# proposal, standard time will be advanced another 30 minutes".  It was further
# proposed that the firing of the time guns likewise be adjusted by 30 minutes
# to compensate.
# From Tim Parenti (2020-12-10), per P Chan (2020-12-11):
# The text of Ordinance 18 of 1919, published in Nigeria Gazette, Vol 6, No 52,

# Tunisia

# From Gwillim Law (2005-04-30):
# My correspondent, Risto Nykänen, has alerted me to another adoption of DST,
# this time in Tunisia.  According to Yahoo France News
# <http://fr.news.yahoo.com/050426/5/4dumk.html>, in a story attributed to AP
# and dated 2005-04-26, "Tunisia has decided to advance its official time by
# one hour, starting on Sunday, May 1.  Henceforth, Tunisian time will be
# UTC+2 instead of UTC+1.  The change will take place at 23:00 UTC next
# Saturday."  (My translation)
#
# From Oscar van Vlijmen (2005-05-02):
# La Presse, the first national daily newspaper ...
# http://www.lapresse.tn/archives/archives280405/actualites/lheure.html
# ... DST for 2005: on: Sun May 1 0h standard time, off: Fri Sept. 30,
# 1h standard time.
#
# From Atef Loukil (2006-03-28):
# The daylight saving time will be the same each year:
# Beginning      : the last Sunday of March at 02:00
# Ending         : the last Sunday of October at 03:00 ...
# http://www.tap.info.tn/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1188&Itemid=50

# From Steffen Thorsen (2009-03-16):
# According to several news sources, Tunisia will not observe DST this year.
# (Arabic)
# http://www.elbashayer.com/?page=viewn&nid=42546
# https://www.babnet.net/kiwidetail-15295.asp
#
# We have also confirmed this with the US embassy in Tunisia.
# We have a wrap-up about this on the following page:

# http://www.tap.info.tn/ar/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=61240&Itemid=1

# From Arthur David Olson (2009-03-18):
# The Tunis Afrique Presse News Agency notice contains this: "This measure is
# due to the fact that the fasting month of Ramadan coincides with the period
# concerned by summer time.  Therefore, the standard time will be kept
# unchanged the whole year long."  So foregoing DST seems to be an exception
# (albeit one that may be repeated in the future).

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2010-03-27):
# According to some news reports Tunis confirmed not to use DST in 2010
#
# (translation):
# "The Tunisian government has decided to abandon DST, which was scheduled on
# Sunday...
# Tunisian authorities had suspended the DST for the first time last year also
# coincided with the month of Ramadan..."

# From Paul-Inge Flakstad (2014-03-10):
# I recently had a long dialog about this with the developer of timegenie.com.
# In the absence of specific dates, he decided to choose some likely ones:
#   GMT +1 - From March 1 to the last Sunday in March
#   GMT +2 - From the last Sunday in March until the last Sunday in October
#   GMT +1 - From the last Sunday in October until November 7
#   GMT +0 - From November 7 until March 1
# The dates for switching to and from UTC+0 will probably not be absolutely
# correct, but they should be quite close to the actual dates.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2014-03-21):
# The CET-switching Troll rules require zic from tz 2014b or later, so as
# suggested by Bengt-Inge Larsson comment them out for now, and approximate
# with only UTC and CEST.  Uncomment them when 2014b is more prevalent.

# All the electric clocks are usually wrong.

# Nanjing Journal of Social Sciences. 2014;(2):144-50.
# http://oversea.cnki.net/kns55/detail.aspx?dbname=CJFD2014&filename=NJSH201402020
# The table lists dates only; I am guessing 00:00 and 24:00 transition times.
# Also, the table lists the planned end of DST in 1949, but the corresponding
# zone line cuts this off on May 28, when the Communists took power.

# From Phake Nick (2020-04-15):
#
# For the history of time in Shanghai between 1940-1942, the situation is
# actually slightly more complex than the table [below]....  At the time,
# there were three different authorities in Shanghai, including Shanghai
# International Settlement, a settlement established by western countries with
# its own westernized form of government, Shanghai French Concession, similar
# to the international settlement but is controlled by French, and then the
# rest of the city of Shanghai, which have already been controlled by Japanese
# force through a puppet local government (Wang Jingwei regime).  It was
# additionally complicated by the circumstances that, according to the 1940s
# Shanghai summer time essay cited in the database, some
# departments/businesses/people in the Shanghai city itself during that time
# period, refused to change their clock and instead only changed their opening
# hours.
#
# For example, as quoted in the article, in 1940, other than the authority
# itself, power, tram, bus companies, cinema, department stores, and other
# public service organizations have all decided to follow the summer time and
# spring forward the clock.  On the other hand, the custom office refused to
# spring forward the clock because of worry on mechanical wear to the physical
# clock, postal office refused to spring forward because of disruption to
# business and log-keeping, although they did changed their office hour to
# match rest of the city.  So is travel agents, and also weather
# observatory.  It is said both time standards had their own supporters in the
# city at the time, those who prefer new time standard would have moved their
# clock while those who prefer the old time standard would keep their clock
# unchange, and there were different clocks that use different time standard
# in the city at the time for people who use different time standard to adjust
# their clock to their preferred time.
#
# a. For the 1940 May 31 spring forward, the essay [says] ... "Hong
# Kong government implemented the spring forward in the same time on
# the same date as Shanghai".
#
# b. For the 1940 fall back, it was said that they initially intended to do
# so on September 30 00:59 at night, however they postponed it to October 12
# after discussion with relevant parties. However schools restored to the
# original schedule ten days earlier.
#
# c. For the 1941 spring forward, it is said to start from March 15
# "following the previous year's method", and in addition to that the essay
# cited an announcement in 1941 from the Wang regime which said the Special
# City of Shanghai under Wang regime control will follow the DST rule set by
# the Settlements, irrespective of the original DST plan announced by the Wang
# regime for other area under its control(April 1 to September 30). (no idea
# to situation before that announcement)
#
# d. For the 1941 fall back, it was said that the fall back would occurs at
# the end of September (A newspaper headline cited by the essay, published on
# October 1, 1941, have the headlines which said "French Concession would

#
# f. For the 1942 spring forward, the essay said that the spring forward

#
# g. The essay itself didn't cover any specific changes thereafter until the
# end of the war, it quoted a November 1942 command from the government of the
# Wang regime, which claim the daylight saving time applies year round during
# the war. However, the essay ambiguously said the period is "February 1 to

# From Paul Eggert (2017-01-05):
# Alois Treindl kindly sent me translations of the following two sources:
#
# (1)
# Guo Qing-sheng (National Time-Service Center, CAS, Xi'an 710600, China)
# Beijing Time at the Beginning of the PRC
# China Historical Materials of Science and Technology
# (Zhongguo ke ji shi liao, 中国科技史料). 2003;24(1):5-9.
# http://oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?filename=ZGKS200301000&dbname=CJFD2003
# It gives evidence that at the beginning of the PRC, Beijing time was
# officially apparent solar time!  However, Guo also says that the
# evidence is dubious, as the relevant institute of astronomy had not
# been taken over by the PRC yet.  It's plausible that apparent solar
# time was announced but never implemented, and that people continued
# to use UT+8.  As the Shanghai radio station (and I presume the
# observatory) was still under control of French missionaries, it
# could well have ignored any such mandate.
#
# (2)
# Guo Qing-sheng (Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory, CAS, Xi'an 710600, China)
# A Study on the Standard Time Changes for the Past 100 Years in China
# [undated and unknown publication location]
# It says several things:
#   * The Qing dynasty used local apparent solar time throughout China.
#   * The Republic of China instituted Beijing mean solar time effective
#     the official calendar book of 1914.
#   * The French Concession in Shanghai set up signal stations in
#     French docks in the 1890s, controlled by Xujiahui (Zikawei)
#     Observatory and set to local mean time.
#   * "From the end of the 19th century" it changed to UT+8.
#   * Chinese Customs (by then reduced to a tool of foreign powers)
#     eventually standardized on this time for all ports, and it
#     became used by railways as well.
#   * In 1918 the Central Observatory proposed dividing China into
#     five time zones (see below for details).  This caught on
#     at first only in coastal areas observing UT+8.
#   * During WWII all of China was in theory was at UT+7.  In practice
#     this was ignored in the west, and I presume was ignored in
#     Japanese-occupied territory.
#   * Japanese-occupied Manchuria was at UT+9, i.e., Japan time.
#   * The five-zone plan was resurrected after WWII and officially put into
#     place (with some modifications) in March 1948.  It's not clear
#     how well it was observed in areas under Nationalist control.
#   * The People's Liberation Army used UT+8 during the civil war.
#
# An AP article "Shanghai Internat'l Area Little Changed" in the
# Lewiston (ME) Daily Sun (1939-05-29), p 17, said "Even the time is
# different - the occupied districts going by Tokyo time, an hour
# ahead of that prevailing in the rest of Shanghai."  Guess that the
# Xujiahui Observatory was under French control and stuck with UT +08.
#
# In earlier versions of this file, China had many separate Zone entries, but
# this was based on what were apparently incorrect data in Shanks & Pottenger.
# This has now been simplified to the two entries Asia/Shanghai and
# Asia/Urumqi, with the others being links for backward compatibility.
# Proposed in 1918 and theoretically in effect until 1949 (although in practice
# mainly observed in coastal areas), the five zones were:
#
# Changbai Time ("Long-white Time", Long-white = Heilongjiang area) UT +08:30
# Now part of Asia/Shanghai; its pre-1970 times are not recorded here.
# Heilongjiang (except Mohe county), Jilin
#
# Zhongyuan Time ("Central plain Time") UT +08
# Now part of Asia/Shanghai.
# most of China
# Milne gives 8:05:43.2 for Xujiahui Observatory time....
# Guo says Shanghai switched to UT +08 "from the end of the 19th century".
#
# Long-shu Time (probably as Long and Shu were two names of the area) UT +07
# Now part of Asia/Shanghai; its pre-1970 times are not recorded here.
# Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Ningxia, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Yunnan;
# most of Gansu; west Inner Mongolia; east Qinghai; and the Guangdong
# counties Deqing, Enping, Kaiping, Luoding, Taishan, Xinxing,
# Yangchun, Yangjiang, Yu'nan, and Yunfu.
#
# Xin-zang Time ("Xinjiang-Tibet Time") UT +06
# This region is now part of either Asia/Urumqi or Asia/Shanghai with
# current boundaries uncertain; times before 1970 for areas that
# disagree with Ürümqi or Shanghai are not recorded here.
# The Gansu counties Aksay, Anxi, Dunhuang, Subei; west Qinghai;
# the Guangdong counties  Xuwen, Haikang, Suixi, Lianjiang,
# Zhanjiang, Wuchuan, Huazhou, Gaozhou, Maoming, Dianbai, and Xinyi;
# east Tibet, including Lhasa, Chamdo, Shigaise, Jimsar, Shawan and Hutubi;
# east Xinjiang, including Ürümqi, Turpan, Karamay, Korla, Minfeng, Jinghe,
# Wusu, Qiemo, Xinyan, Wulanwusu, Jinghe, Yumin, Tacheng, Tuoli, Emin,
# Shihezi, Changji, Yanqi, Heshuo, Tuokexun, Tulufan, Shanshan, Hami,
# Fukang, Kuitun, Kumukuli, Miquan, Qitai, and Turfan.
#
# Kunlun Time UT +05:30
# This region is now in the same status as Xin-zang Time (see above).
# West Tibet, including Pulan, Aheqi, Shufu, Shule;
# West Xinjiang, including Aksu, Atushi, Yining, Hetian, Cele, Luopu, Nileke,
# Zhaosu, Tekesi, Gongliu, Chabuchaer, Huocheng, Bole, Pishan, Suiding,
# and Yarkand.

# From Luther Ma (2009-10-17):
# Almost all (>99.9%) ethnic Chinese (properly ethnic Han) living in
# Xinjiang use Chinese Standard Time. Some are aware of Xinjiang time,
# but have no need of it. All planes, trains, and schools function on
# what is called "Beijing time." When Han make an appointment in Chinese
# they implicitly use Beijing time.
#
# On the other hand, ethnic Uyghurs, who make up about half the
# population of Xinjiang, typically use "Xinjiang time" which is two
# hours behind Beijing time, or UT +06. The government of the Xinjiang
# Uyghur Autonomous Region, (XAUR, or just Xinjiang for short) as well as
# local governments such as the Ürümqi city government use both times in
# publications, referring to what is popularly called Xinjiang time as
# "Ürümqi time." When Uyghurs make an appointment in the Uyghur language
# they almost invariably use Xinjiang time.
#
# (Their ethnic Han compatriots would typically have no clue of its
# widespread use, however, because so extremely few of them are fluent in
# Uyghur, comparable to the number of Anglo-Americans fluent in Navajo.)
#
# (...As with the rest of China there was a brief interval ending in 1990
# or 1991 when summer time was in use.  The confusion was severe, with
# the province not having dual times but four times in use at the same
# time. Some areas remained on standard Xinjiang time or Beijing time and
# others moving their clocks ahead.)

# From Luther Ma (2009-11-19):
# With the risk of being redundant to previous answers these are the most common
# English "transliterations" (w/o using non-English symbols):
#
# 1. Wulumuqi...
# 2. Kashi...
# 3. Urumqi...
# 4. Kashgar...
# ...
# 5. It seems that Uyghurs in Ürümqi has been using Xinjiang since at least the
# 1960's. I know of one Han, now over 50, who grew up in the surrounding
# countryside and used Xinjiang time as a child.
#
# 6. Likewise for Kashgar and the rest of south Xinjiang I don't know of any
# start date for Xinjiang time.
#
# Without having access to local historical records, nor the ability to legally
# publish them, I would go with October 1, 1949, when Xinjiang became the Uyghur
# Autonomous Region under the PRC. (Before that Uyghurs, of course, would also
# not be using Beijing time, but some local time.)

# From David Cochrane (2014-03-26):
# Just a confirmation that Ürümqi time was implemented in Ürümqi on 1 Feb 1986:
# https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960684,00.html

# From Luther Ma (2014-04-22):
# I have interviewed numerous people of various nationalities and from
# different localities in Xinjiang and can confirm the information in Guo's
# report regarding Xinjiang, as well as the Time article reference by David
# Cochrane.  Whether officially recognized or not (and both are officially
# recognized), two separate times have been in use in Xinjiang since at least
# the Cultural Revolution: Xinjiang Time (XJT), aka Ürümqi Time or local time;
# and Beijing Time.  There is no confusion in Xinjiang as to which name refers
# to which time. Both are widely used in the province, although in some
# population groups might be use one to the exclusion of the other.  The only
# problem is that computers and smart phones list Ürümqi (or Kashgar) as
# having the same time as Beijing.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
# In the early days of the PRC, Tibet was given its own time zone (UT +06)
# but this was withdrawn in 1959 and never reinstated; see Tubten Khétsun,
# Memories of life in Lhasa under Chinese Rule, Columbia U Press, ISBN
# 978-0231142861 (2008), translator's introduction by Matthew Akester, p x.
# As this is before our 1970 cutoff, Tibet doesn't need a separate zone.
#
# Xinjiang Time is well-documented as being officially recognized.  E.g., see
# "The Working-Calendar for The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Government"
# <http://www.sinkiang.gov.cn/service/ourworking/> (2014-04-22).
# Unfortunately, we have no good records of time in Xinjiang before 1986.
# During the 20th century parts of Xinjiang were ruled by the Qing dynasty,
# the Republic of China, various warlords, the First and Second East Turkestan
# Republics, the Soviet Union, the Kuomintang, and the People's Republic of
# China, and tracking down all these organizations' timekeeping rules would be
# quite a trick.  Approximate this lost history by a transition from LMT to
# UT +06 at the start of 1928, the year of accession of the warlord Jin Shuren,
# which happens to be the date given by Shanks & Pottenger (no doubt as a
# guess) as the transition from LMT.  Ignore the usage of +08 before
# 1986-02-01 under the theory that the transition date to +08 is unknown and
# that the sort of users who prefer Asia/Urumqi now typically ignored the
# +08 mandate back then.

# Morning Post for October 1st was indeed moved by half an hour compares to
# before.  After that, in December, the battle to capture Hong Kong started and
# the library doesn't seems to have any record stored about press during that
# period of time.  Some media resumed publication soon after that within the
# same month, but there were not much information about time there.  Later they
# started including a radio program guide when they restored radio service,
# explicitly mentioning it use Tokyo standard time, and later added a note

# Taiwan

# From smallufo (2010-04-03):
# According to Taiwan's CWB [Central Weather Bureau],
# http://www.cwb.gov.tw/V6/astronomy/cdata/summert.htm
# Taipei has DST in 1979 between July 1st and Sep 30.

# From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2013-07-12):
# On Dec 28, 1895, the Meiji Emperor announced Ordinance No. 167 of
# Meiji Year 28 "The clause about standard time", mentioned that
# Taiwan and Penghu Islands, as well as Yaeyama and Miyako Islands
# (both in Okinawa) adopt the Western Standard Time which is based on
# 120E. The adoption began from Jan 1, 1896. The original text can be
# found on Wikisource:
# https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/標準時ニ關スル件_(公布時)
# ... This could be the first adoption of time zone in Taiwan, because
# during the Qing Dynasty, it seems that there was no time zone
# declared officially.
#
# Later, in the beginning of World War II, on Sep 25, 1937, the Showa
# Emperor announced Ordinance No. 529 of Showa Year 12 "The clause of
# revision in the ordinance No. 167 of Meiji year 28 about standard
# time", in which abolished the adoption of Western Standard Time in
# western islands (listed above), which means the whole Japan
# territory, including later occupations, adopt Japan Central Time
# (UT+9). The adoption began on Oct 1, 1937. The original text can
# be found on Wikisource:
# https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/明治二十八年勅令第百六十七號標準時ニ關スル件中改正ノ件
#
# That is, the time zone of Taipei switched to UT+9 on Oct 1, 1937.

# From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-02):
# I've found more evidence about when the time zone was switched from UT+9
# back to UT+8 after WW2.  I believe it was on Sep 21, 1945.  In a document
# during Japanese era [1] in which the officer told the staff to change time
# zone back to Western Standard Time (UT+8) on Sep 21.  And in another
# history page of National Cheng Kung University [2], on Sep 21 there is a
# note "from today, switch back to Western Standard Time".  From these two
# materials, I believe that the time zone change happened on Sep 21.  And
# today I have found another monthly journal called "The Astronomical Herald"
# from The Astronomical Society of Japan [3] in which it mentioned the fact
# that:
#
# 1. Standard Time of the Country (Japan) was adopted on Jan 1, 1888, using
# the time at 135E (GMT+9)
#
# 2. Standard Time of the Country was renamed to Central Standard Time, on Jan
# 1, 1898, and on the same day, the new territories Taiwan and Penghu islands,
# as well as Yaeyama and Miyako islands, adopted a new time zone called
# Western Standard Time, which is in GMT+8.
#
# 3. Western Standard Time was deprecated on Sep 30, 1937. From then all the
# territories of Japan adopted the same time zone, which is Central Standard
# Time.

# Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-03):
# I finally have found the real official gazette about changing back to
# Western Standard Time on Sep 21 in Taiwan.  It's Taiwan Governor-General
# Bulletin No. 386 in Showa 20 years (1945), published on Sep 19, 1945. [1] ...
# [It] abolishes Bulletin No. 207 in Showa 12 years (1937), which is a local
# bulletin in Taiwan for that Ordinance No. 529. It also mentioned that 1am on
# Sep 21, 1945 will be 12am on Sep 21.  I think this bulletin is much more
# official than the one I mentioned in my first mail, because it's from the
# top-level government in Taiwan. If you're going to quote any resource, this
# would be a good one.
# [1] Taiwan Governor-General Gazette, No. 1018, Sep 19, 1945:
# http://db2.th.gov.tw/db2/view/viewImg.php?imgcode=0072031018a&num=19&bgn=019&end=019&otherImg=&type=gener

# From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-02):
# In 1946, DST in Taiwan was from May 15 and ended on Sep 30. The info from
# Central Weather Bureau website was not correct.
#
# Original Bulletin:
# http://subtpg.tpg.gov.tw/og/image2.asp?f=03502F0AKM1AF
# http://subtpg.tpg.gov.tw/og/image2.asp?f=0350300AKM1B0 (cont.)
#
# In 1947, DST in Taiwan was expanded to Oct 31. There is a backup of that
# telegram announcement from Taiwan Province Government:
#
# http://subtpg.tpg.gov.tw/og/image2.asp?f=0360310AKZ431
#
# Here is a brief translation:
#
#   The Summer Time this year is adopted from midnight Apr 15 until Sep 20
#   midnight. To save (energy?) consumption, we're expanding Summer Time
#   adoption till Oct 31 midnight.
#
# The Central Weather Bureau website didn't mention that, however it can
# be found from historical government announcement database.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-03):
# As per Yu-Cheng Chuang, say that Taiwan was at UT +09 from 1937-10-01
# until 1945-09-21 at 01:00, overriding Shanks & Pottenger.
# Likewise, use Yu-Cheng Chuang's data for DST in Taiwan.

# Macau (Macao, Aomen)
#
# From P Chan (2018-05-10):
# * LegisMac
#   http://legismac.safp.gov.mo/legismac/descqry/Descqry.jsf?lang=pt
#   A database for searching titles of legal documents of Macau in
#   Chinese and Portuguese.  The term "HORÁRIO DE VERÃO" can be used for
#   searching decrees about summer time.
# * Archives of Macao
#   http://www.archives.gov.mo/en/bo/
#   It contains images of old official gazettes.
# * The Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau have a page listing the
#   summer time history.  But it is not complete and has some mistakes.
#   http://www.smg.gov.mo/smg/geophysics/e_t_Summer%20Time.htm
# Macau adopted GMT+8 on 30 Oct 1904 to follow Hong Kong.  Clocks were
# advanced by 25 minutes and 50 seconds.  Which means the LMT used was
# +7:34:10.  As stated in the "Portaria No. 204" dated 21 October 1904
# and published in the Official Gazette on 29 October 1904.
# http://igallery.icm.gov.mo/Images/Archives/BO/MO_AH_PUB_BO_1904_10/MO_AH_PUB_BO_1904_10_00025_Grey.JPG

# Georgia
# From Paul Eggert (1994-11-19):
# Today's _Economist_ (p 60) reports that Georgia moved its clocks forward
# an hour recently, due to a law proposed by Zurab Murvanidze,
# an MP who went on a hunger strike for 11 days to force discussion about it!
# We have no details, but we'll guess they didn't move the clocks back in fall.
#
# From Mathew Englander, quoting AP (1996-10-23 13:05-04):
# Instead of putting back clocks at the end of October, Georgia
# will stay on daylight savings time this winter to save energy,
# President Eduard Shevardnadze decreed Wednesday.
#
# From the BBC via Joseph S. Myers (2004-06-27):
#
# Georgia moved closer to Western Europe on Sunday...  The former Soviet
# republic has changed its time zone back to that of Moscow.  As a result it
# is now just four hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time, rather than five hours
# ahead.  The switch was decreed by the pro-Western president of Georgia,
# Mikheil Saakashvili, who said the change was partly prompted by the process
# of integration into Europe.

# From Teimuraz Abashidze (2005-11-07):
# Government of Georgia ... decided to NOT CHANGE daylight savings time on
# [Oct.] 30, as it was done before during last more than 10 years.
# Currently, we are in fact GMT +4:00, as before 30 October it was GMT
# +3:00.... The problem is, there is NO FORMAL LAW or governmental document
# about it.  As far as I can find, I was told, that there is no document,
# because we just DIDN'T ISSUE document about switching to winter time....
# I don't know what can be done, especially knowing that some years ago our
# DST rules where changed THREE TIMES during one month.

# Milne 1899 says Tbilisi (Tiflis) time was 2:59:05.7.
# Byalokoz 1919 says Georgia was 2:59:11.
# Go with Byalokoz.

# East Timor

# See Indonesia for the 1945 transition.

# From João Carrascalão, brother of the former governor of East Timor, in
# East Timor may be late for its millennium
# <https://etan.org/et99c/december/26-31/30ETMAY.htm> (1999-12-26/31):
# Portugal tried to change the time forward in 1974 because the sun
# rises too early but the suggestion raised a lot of problems with the
# Timorese and I still don't think it would work today because it
# conflicts with their way of life.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-12-04):
# We don't have any record of the above attempt.
# Most likely our records are incomplete, but we have no better data.

# From Manoel de Almeida e Silva, Deputy Spokesman for the UN Secretary-General
# http://www.hri.org/news/world/undh/2000/00-08-16.undh.html
# (2000-08-16):
# The Cabinet of the East Timor Transition Administration decided

# which will be permanent, with no seasonal adjustment, will happen at
# midnight on Saturday, September 16.

# India

# British astronomer Henry Park Hollis disliked India Standard Time's offset:
# "A new time system has been proposed for India, Further India, and Burmah.
# The scheme suggested is that the times of the meridians 5½ and 6½ hours
# east of Greenwich should be adopted in these territories.  No reason is
# given why hourly meridians five hours and six hours east should not be
# chosen; a plan which would bring the time of India into harmony with
# that of almost the whole of the civilised world."

# (2015-12-22):
# In January 1906, several thousand cotton-mill workers rioted on the
# outskirts of Bombay....  They were protesting the proposed abolition of
# local time in favor of Indian Standard Time....  Journalists called this

# From Paul Eggert (2017-04-20):
# Good luck trying to nail down old timekeeping records in India.
# "... in the nineteenth century ... Madras Observatory took its magnetic
# measurements on Göttingen time, its meteorological measurements on Madras
# (local) time, dropped its time ball on Greenwich (ocean navigator's) time,
# and distributed civil (local time)." -- Bartky IR. Selling the true time:
# 19th-century timekeeping in america. Stanford U Press (2000), 247 note 19.
# "A more potent cause of resistance to the general adoption of the present
# standard time lies in the fact that it is Madras time.  The citizen of
# Bombay, proud of being 'primus in Indis' and of Calcutta, equally proud of
# his city being the Capital of India, and - for a part of the year - the Seat
# of the Supreme Government, alike look down on Madras, and refuse to change
# the time they are using, for that of what they regard as a benighted
# Presidency; while Madras, having for long given the standard time to the
# rest of India, would resist the adoption of any other Indian standard in its
# place." -- Oldham RD. On Time in India: a suggestion for its improvement.
# Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (April 1899), 49-55.
#
# "In 1870 ... Madras time - 'now used by the telegraph and regulated from the
# only government observatory' - was suggested as a standard railway time,
# first to be adopted on the Great Indian Peninsular Railway (GIPR)....
# Calcutta, Bombay, and Karachi, were to be allowed to continue with their
# local time for civil purposes." - Prasad R. Tracks of Change: Railways and

# This lists +052110 as Madras local time used in railways, and says that on
# 1906-01-01 railways and telegraphs in India switched to +0530.  Some
# municipalities retained their former time, and the time in Calcutta
# continued to depend on whether you were at the railway station or at
# government offices.  Government time was at +055320 (according to Shanks) or
# at +0554 (according to the Indian Year Book).  Railway time is more
# appropriate for our purposes, as it was better documented, it is what we do
# elsewhere (e.g., Europe/London before 1880), and after 1906 it was
# consistent in the region now identified by Asia/Kolkata.  So, use railway
# time for 1870-1941.  Shanks is our only (and dubious) source for the
# 1941-1945 data.

# Iran

# From Roozbeh Pournader (2022-05-30):
# Here's an order from the Cabinet to the rest of the government to switch to
# Tehran time, which is mentioned to be already at +03:30:
# https://qavanin.ir/Law/TreeText/180138
# Just in case that goes away, I also saved a copy at archive.org:
# https://web.archive.org/web/20220530111940/https://qavanin.ir/Law/TreeText/180138
# Here's my translation:
#
# "Circular on Matching the Hours of Governmental and Official Circles
# in Provinces
# Approved 1314/03/22 [=1935-06-13]
# According to the ruling of the Honorable Cabinet, it is ordered that from
# now on in all internal provinces of the country, governmental and official
# circles set their time to match Tehran time (three hours and half before
# Greenwich)....
#
# I still haven't found out when Tehran itself switched to +03:30....
#
# From Paul Eggert (2022-06-05):
# Although the above says Tehran was at +03:30 before 1935-06-13, we don't
# know when it switched to +03:30.  For now, use 1935-06-13 as the switch date.
# Although most likely wrong, we have no better info.

# From Roozbeh Pournader (2022-06-01):
# This is from Kayhan newspaper, one of the major Iranian newspapers, from
# March 20, 1978, page 2:
#
# "Pull the clocks 60 minutes forward
# As we informed before, from the fourth day of the month Farvardin of the
# new year [=1978-03-24], clocks will be pulled forward, and people's daily
# work and life program will start one hour earlier than the current program.
# On the 1st day of the month Farvardin of this year [=1977-03-21], they had
# pulled the clocks forward by one hour, but in the month of Mehr
# [=1977-09-23], the clocks were pulled back by 30 minutes.
# In this way, from the 4th day of the month Farvardin, clocks will be ahead
# of the previous years by one hour and a half.
# According to the new program, during the night of 4th of Farvardin, when
# the midnight, meaning 24 o'clock is announced, the hands of the clock must
# be pulled forward by one hour and thus consider midnight 1 o'clock in the
# forenoon."
#
# This implies that in September 1977, when the daylight savings time was
# done with, Iran didn't go back to +03:30, but immediately to +04:00.
#
#
# This is from the major Iranian newspaper Ettela'at, dated [1978-08-03]...,
# page 32. It looks like they decided to get the clocks back to +4:00
# just in time for Ramadan that year:
#
# "Tomorrow Night, Pull the Clocks Back by One Hour
# At 1 o'clock in the forenoon of Saturday 14 Mordad [=1978-08-05], the
# clocks will be pulled one hour back and instead of 1 o'clock in the
# forenoon, Radio Iran will announce 24 o'clock.
# This decision was made in the Cabinet of Ministers meeting of 25 Tir
# [=1978-07-16], [...]
# At the beginning of the year 2537 [=March 1978: Iran was using a different
# year number for a few years then, based on the Coronation of Cyrus the
# Great], the country's official time was pulled forward by one hour and now
# the official time is one hour and a half ahead compared to last year,
# because in Farvardin of last year [=March 1977], the official time was
# pulled forward one hour and this continued until the second half of last
# year [=September 1977] until in the second half of last year the official
# time was pulled back half an hour and that half hour still remains."
#
# This matches the time of the true noon published in the newspapers, as they
# clearly go from +05:00 to +04:00 after that date (which happened during a
# long weekend in Iran).

# From Roozbeh Pournader (2022-05-31):
# [Movahedi S. Cultural preconceptions of time: Can we use operational time
# to meddle in God's Time? Comp Stud Soc Hist. 1985;27(3):385-400]
# https://www.jstor.org/stable/178704
# Here's the quotes from the paper:
# 1. '"Iran's official time keeper moved the clock one hour forward as from
# March 22, 1977 (Farvardin 2, 2536) to make maximum use of daylight and save
# in energy consumption. Thus Iran joined such other countries as Britain in
# observing what is known as 'daylight saving.' The proposal was originally
# put forward by the Ministry of Energy, in no way having any influence on
# observing religious ceremonies. Moving time one hour forward in summer
# means that at 11:00 o'clock on March 21, the official time was set as
# midnight March 22. Then September 24 will actually begin one hour later
# than the end of September 23 [...]." Iran's time base thus continued to be
# Greenwich Mean Time plus three and one-half hours (plus four and one-half
# hours in summer).'
#
# The article sources this from Iran Almanac and Book of Facts, 1977, Tehran:
# Echo of Iran, which is on Google Books at
# https://www.google.com/books/edition/Iran_Almanac_and_Book_of_Facts/9ybVAAAAMAAJ.
# (I confirmed it by searching for snippets.)
#
# 2. "After the fall of the shah, the revolutionary government returned to
# daylight-saving time (DST) on 26 May 1979."
#
# This seems to have been announced just one day in advance, on 25 May 1979.
#
# The change in 1977 clearly seems to be the first daylight savings effort in
# Iran. But the article doesn't mention what happened in 1978 (which was
# still during the shah's government), or how things continued in 1979
# onwards (which was during the Islamic Republic).

# From Francis Santoni (2022-06-01):
# for Iran and 1977 the effective change is only 20 October
# (UIT No. 143 17.XI.1977) and not 23 September (UIT No. 141 13.IX.1977).
# UIT is the Operational Bulletin of International Telecommunication Union.

# From Roozbeh Pournader (2003-03-15):
# This is an English translation of what I just found (originally in Persian).
# The Gregorian dates in brackets are mine:
#
#	Official Newspaper No. 13548-1370/6/25 [1991-09-16]
#	No. 16760/T233 H				1370/6/10 [1991-09-01]
#
#	The Rule About Change of the Official Time of the Country
#
#	The Board of Ministers, in the meeting dated 1370/5/23 [1991-08-14],
#	based on the suggestion number 2221/D dated 1370/4/22 [1991-07-13]
#	of the Country's Organization for Official and Employment Affairs,
#	and referring to the law for equating the working hours of workers
#	and officers in the whole country dated 1359/4/23 [1980-07-14], and
#	for synchronizing the official times of the country, agreed that:
#
#	The official time of the country will should move forward one hour
#	at the 24[:00] hours of the first day of Farvardin and should return
#	to its previous state at the 24[:00] hours of the 30th day of
#	Shahrivar.
#
#	First Deputy to the President - Hassan Habibi
#
# From personal experience, that agrees with what has been followed
# for at least the last 5 years.  Before that, for a few years, the
# date used was the first Thursday night of Farvardin and the last
# Thursday night of Shahrivar, but I can't give exact dates....
#
# From Roozbeh Pournader (2005-04-05):
# The text of the Iranian law, in effect since 1925, clearly mentions
# that the true solar year is the measure, and there is no arithmetic
# leap year calculation involved.  There has never been any serious
# plan to change that law....
#
# From Paul Eggert (2022-06-30):
# Go with Pournader for 1935 through spring 1979, and for timestamps
# after August 1991; go with with Shanks & Pottenger for other timestamps.
# Go with Santoni's citation of the UIT for fall 1977, as 20 October 1977
# is 28 Mehr 1356, consistent with the "Mehr" in Pournader's source.
# Assume that the UIT's "1930" is UTC, i.e., 24:00 local time.
#
# From Oscar van Vlijmen (2005-03-30), writing about future
# discrepancies between cal-persia and the Iranian calendar:
# For 2091 solar-longitude-after yields 2091-03-20 08:40:07.7 UT for
# the vernal equinox and that gets so close to 12:00 some local
# Iranian time that the definition of the correct location needs to be
# known exactly, amongst other factors.  2157 is even closer:
# 2157-03-20 08:37:15.5 UT.  But the Gregorian year 2025 should give
# no interpretation problem whatsoever.  By the way, another instant
# in the near future where there will be a discrepancy between
# arithmetical and astronomical Iranian calendars will be in 2058:
# vernal equinox on 2058-03-20 09:03:05.9 UT.  The Java version of
# Reingold's/Dershowitz' calculator gives correctly the Gregorian date
# 2058-03-21 for 1 Farvardin 1437 (astronomical).
#

# Iraq
#
# From Jonathan Lennox (2000-06-12):
# An article in this week's Economist ("Inside the Saddam-free zone", p. 50 in
# the U.S. edition) on the Iraqi Kurds contains a paragraph:
# "The three northern provinces ... switched their clocks this spring and
# are an hour ahead of Baghdad."
#
# But Rives McDow (2000-06-18) quotes a contact in Iraqi-Kurdistan as follows:
# In the past, some Kurdish nationalists, as a protest to the Iraqi
# Government, did not adhere to daylight saving time.  They referred
# to daylight saving as Saddam time.  But, as of today, the time zone
# in Iraqi-Kurdistan is on standard time with Baghdad, Iraq.
#
# So we'll ignore the Economist's claim.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-03-10):
# The cabinet in Iraq abolished DST last week, according to the following
# news sources (in Arabic):
# http://www.aljeeran.net/wesima_articles/news-20080305-98602.html
# http://www.aswataliraq.info/look/article.tpl?id=2047&IdLanguage=17&IdPublication=4&NrArticle=71743&NrIssue=1&NrSection=10

# We have published a short article in English about the change:

# Israel

# For more info about the motivation for DST in Israel, see:
# Barak Y. Israel's Daylight Saving Time controversy. Israel Affairs.
# 2020-08-11. https://doi.org/10.1080/13537121.2020.1806564

# From Ephraim Silverberg (2001-01-11):
#
# I coined "IST/IDT" circa 1988.  Until then there were three
# different abbreviations in use:
#
# JST  Jerusalem Standard Time [Danny Braniss, Hebrew University]
# IZT  Israel Zonal (sic) Time [Prof. Haim Papo, Technion]
# EEST Eastern Europe Standard Time [used by almost everyone else]
#
# Since timezones should be called by country and not capital cities,
# I ruled out JST.  As Israel is in Asia Minor and not Eastern Europe,
# EEST was equally unacceptable.  Since "zonal" was not compatible with
# any other timezone abbreviation, I felt that 'IST' was the way to go
# and, indeed, it has received almost universal acceptance in timezone
# settings in Israeli computers.
#
# In any case, I am happy to share timezone abbreviations with India,
# high on my favorite-country list (and not only because my wife's
# family is from India).

# From Paul Eggert (2020-10-27):
# Several of the midnight transitions mentioned above are ambiguous;
# are they 00:00, 00:00s, 24:00, or 24:00s?  When resolving these ambiguities,
# try to minimize changes from previous tzdb versions, for lack of better info.
# Commentary from previous versions is included below, to help explain this.

# From Ephraim Silverberg
# (1997-03-04, 1998-03-16, 1998-12-28, 2000-01-17, 2000-07-25, 2004-12-22,
# and 2005-02-17):

# According to the Office of the Secretary General of the Ministry of
# Interior, there is NO set rule for Daylight-Savings/Standard time changes.
# One thing is entrenched in law, however: that there must be at least 150
# days of daylight savings time annually.  From 1993-1998, the change to
# daylight savings time was on a Friday morning from midnight IST to
# 1 a.m IDT; up until 1998, the change back to standard time was on a
# Saturday night from midnight daylight savings time to 11 p.m. standard
# time.  1996 is an exception to this rule where the change back to standard
# time took place on Sunday night instead of Saturday night to avoid
# conflicts with the Jewish New Year.  In 1999, the change to
# daylight savings time was still on a Friday morning but from
# 2 a.m. IST to 3 a.m. IDT; furthermore, the change back to standard time
# was also on a Friday morning from 2 a.m. IDT to 1 a.m. IST for
# 1999 only.  In the year 2000, the change to daylight savings time was
# similar to 1999, but although the change back will be on a Friday, it
# will take place from 1 a.m. IDT to midnight IST.  Starting in 2001, all
# changes to/from will take place at 1 a.m. old time, but now there is no
# rule as to what day of the week it will take place in as the start date
# (except in 2003) is the night after the Passover Seder (i.e. the eve
# of the 16th of Nisan in the lunar Hebrew calendar) and the end date
# (except in 2002) is three nights before Yom Kippur [Day of Atonement]
# (the eve of the 7th of Tishrei in the lunar Hebrew calendar).

###############################################################################

# Japan

# '9:00' and 'JST' is from Guy Harris.

# From Paul Eggert (2020-01-19):
# Starting in the 7th century, Japan generally followed an ancient Chinese
# timekeeping system that divided night and day into six hours each,
# with hour length depending on season.  In 1873 the government
# started requiring the use of a Western style 24-hour clock.  See:
# Yulia Frumer, "Making Time: Astronomical Time Measurement in Tokugawa Japan"
# <https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1043907065>.  As the tzdb code and
# data support only 24-hour clocks, its tables model timestamps before
# 1873 using Western-style local mean time.

# From Hideyuki Suzuki (1998-11-09):
# 'Tokyo' usually stands for the former location of Tokyo Astronomical
# Observatory: 139° 44' 40.90" E (9h 18m 58.727s), 35° 39' 16.0" N.
# This data is from 'Rika Nenpyou (Chronological Scientific Tables) 1996'
# edited by National Astronomical Observatory of Japan....
# JST (Japan Standard Time) has been used since 1888-01-01 00:00 (JST).
# The law is enacted on 1886-07-07.

# From Hideyuki Suzuki (1998-11-16):
# The ordinance No. 51 (1886) established "standard time" in Japan,
# which stands for the time on 135° E.
# In the ordinance No. 167 (1895), "standard time" was renamed to "central
# standard time".  And the same ordinance also established "western standard
# time", which stands for the time on 120° E....  But "western standard
# time" was abolished in the ordinance No. 529 (1937).  In the ordinance No.
# 167, there is no mention regarding for what place western standard time is
# standard....
#
# I wrote "ordinance" above, but I don't know how to translate.
# In Japanese it's "chokurei", which means ordinance from emperor.

# From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2013-07-12):
# ...the Meiji Emperor announced Ordinance No. 167 of Meiji Year 28 "The clause
# about standard time" ... The adoption began from Jan 1, 1896.
# https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/標準時ニ關スル件_(公布時)
#
# ...the Showa Emperor announced Ordinance No. 529 of Showa Year 12 ... which
# means the whole Japan territory, including later occupations, adopt Japan
# Central Time (UT+9). The adoption began on Oct 1, 1937.
# https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/明治二十八年勅令第百六十七號標準時ニ關スル件中改正ノ件

# From Paul Eggert (1995-03-06):
# Today's _Asahi Evening News_ (page 4) reports that Japan had
# daylight saving between 1948 and 1951, but "the system was discontinued
# because the public believed it would lead to longer working hours."

# From Mayumi Negishi in the 2005-08-10 Japan Times:
# http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20050810f2.htm
# Occupation authorities imposed daylight-saving time on Japan on
# [1948-05-01]....  But lack of prior debate and the execution of
# daylight-saving time just three days after the bill was passed generated
# deep hatred of the concept....  The Diet unceremoniously passed a bill to
# dump the unpopular system in October 1951, less than a month after the San
# Francisco Peace Treaty was signed.  (A government poll in 1951 showed 53%
# of the Japanese wanted to scrap daylight-saving time, as opposed to 30% who
# wanted to keep it.)

# From Takayuki Nikai (2018-01-19):
# The source of information is Japanese law.
# http://www.shugiin.go.jp/internet/itdb_housei.nsf/html/houritsu/00219480428029.htm
# http://www.shugiin.go.jp/internet/itdb_housei.nsf/html/houritsu/00719500331039.htm
# ... In summary, it is written as follows.  From 24:00 on the first Saturday
# in May, until 0:00 on the day after the second Saturday in September.

# From Phake Nick (2018-09-27):
# [T]he webpage authored by National Astronomical Observatory of Japan
# https://eco.mtk.nao.ac.jp/koyomi/wiki/BBFEB9EF2FB2C6BBFEB9EF.html
# ... mentioned that using Showa 23 (year 1948) as example, 13pm of September
# 11 in summer time will equal to 0am of September 12 in standard time.
# It cited a document issued by the Liaison Office which briefly existed
# during the postwar period of Japan, where the detail on implementation
# of the summer time is described in the document.
# https://eco.mtk.nao.ac.jp/koyomi/wiki/BBFEB9EF2FB2C6BBFEB9EFB2C6BBFEB9EFA4CEBCC2BBDCA4CBA4C4A4A4A4C6.pdf
# The text in the document do instruct a fall back to occur at
# September 11, 13pm in summer time, while ordinary citizens can
# change the clock before they sleep.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-09-27):
# This instruction is equivalent to "Sat>=8 25:00", so use that.  zic treats
# it like "Sun>=9 01:00", which is not quite the same but is the best we can
# do in any POSIX or C platform.  The "25:00" assumes zic from 2007 or later,
# which should be safe now.

# So - this means the midnight between Thursday and Friday since 2002.

# From Arthur David Olson (2009-04-06):

# (and they will use DST again next year, using the normal schedule).

# From Paul Eggert (2013-12-11):
# As Steffen suggested, consider the past 21-month experiment to be DST.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2021-09-24):

# daylight saving time citing lack of economic benefits and health
# complications coupled with a decrease in productivity.
#
# From Branislav Kojic (in Astana) via Gwillim Law (2005-06-28):
# ... what happened was that the former Kazakhstan Eastern time zone
# was "blended" with the Central zone.  Therefore, Kazakhstan now has
# two time zones, and difference between them is one hour.  The zone
# closer to UTC is the former Western zone (probably still called the
# same), encompassing four provinces in the west: Aqtöbe, Atyraū,
# Mangghystaū, and West Kazakhstan.  The other zone encompasses
# everything else....  I guess that would make Kazakhstan time zones
# de jure UTC+5 and UTC+6 respectively.

# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-27):
# Review of the linked documents from http://adilet.zan.kz/
# produced the following data for post-1991 Kazakhstan:
#
# 0. Act of the Cabinet of Ministers of the USSR
# from 1991-02-04 No. 20
# http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?docbody=&nd=102010545
# removed the extra hour ("decree time") on the territory of the USSR
# starting with the last Sunday of March 1991.
# It also allowed (but not mandated) Kazakh SSR, Kirghiz SSR, Tajik SSR,
# Turkmen SSR and Uzbek SSR to not have "summer" time.
#
# The 1992-01-13 act also refers to the act of the Cabinet of Ministers
# of the Kazakh SSR from 1991-03-20 No. 170 "About the act of the Cabinet
# of Ministers of the USSR from 1991-02-04 No. 20" but I didn't found its
# text.
#
# According to Izvestia newspaper No. 68 (23334) from 1991-03-20
# -- page 6; available at http://libinfo.org/newsr/newsr2574.djvu via
# http://libinfo.org/index.php?id=58564 -- on 1991-03-31 at 2:00 during
# transition to "summer" time:
# Republic of Georgia, Latvian SSR, Lithuanian SSR, SSR Moldova,
# Estonian SSR; Komi ASSR; Kaliningrad oblast; Nenets autonomous okrug
# were to move clocks 1 hour forward.
# Kazakh SSR (excluding Uralsk oblast); Republic of Kyrgyzstan, Tajik
# SSR; Andijan, Jizzakh, Namangan, Sirdarya, Tashkent, Fergana oblasts
# of the Uzbek SSR were to move clocks 1 hour backwards.
# Other territories were to not move clocks.
# When the "summer" time would end on 1991-09-29, clocks were to be
# moved 1 hour backwards on the territory of the USSR excluding
# Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenia, Tajikistan.
#
# Apparently there were last minute changes. Apparently Kazakh act No. 170
# was one of such changes.
#
# https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Декретное_время
# claims that Sovetskaya Rossiya newspaper on 1991-03-29 published that
# Nenets autonomous okrug, Komi and Kazakhstan (excluding Uralsk oblast)
# were to not move clocks and Uralsk oblast was to move clocks
# forward; on 1991-09-29 Kazakhstan was to move clocks backwards.
# (Probably there were changes even after that publication. There is an
# article claiming that Kaliningrad oblast decided on 1991-03-29 to not
# move clocks.)
#
# This implies that on 1991-03-31 Asia/Oral remained on +04/+05 while
# the rest of Kazakhstan switched from +06/+07 to +05/06 or from +05/06
# to +04/+05. It's unclear how Qyzylorda oblast moved into the fifth
# time belt. (By switching from +04/+05 to +05/+06 on 1991-09-29?) ...
#
# 1. Act of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 1992-01-13 No. 28
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P920000028_
# (text includes modification from the 1996 act)
# introduced new rules for calculation of time, mirroring Russian
# 1992-01-08 act.  It specified that time would be calculated
# according to time belts plus extra hour ("decree time"), moved clocks
# on the whole territory of Kazakhstan 1 hour forward on 1992-01-19 at
# 2:00, specified DST rules.  It acknowledged that Kazakhstan was
# located in the fourth and the fifth time belts and specified the
# border between them to be located east of Qostanay and Aktyubinsk
# oblasts (notably including Turgai and Qyzylorda oblasts into the fifth
# time belt).
#
# This means switch on 1992-01-19 at 2:00 from +04/+05 to +05/+06 for
# Asia/Aqtau, Asia/Aqtobe, Asia/Oral, Atyraū and Qostanay oblasts; from
# +05/+06 to +06/+07 for Asia/Almaty and Asia/Qyzylorda (and Arkalyk)....
#
# 2. Act of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 1992-03-27 No. 284
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P920000284_
# cancels extra hour ("decree time") for Uralsk and Qyzylorda oblasts
# since the last Sunday of March 1992, while keeping them in the fourth
# and the fifth time belts respectively.
#
# 3. Order of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 1994-09-23 No. 384
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/R940000384_
# cancels the extra hour ("decree time") on the territory of Mangghystaū
# oblast since the last Sunday of September 1994 (saying that time on
# the territory would correspond to the third time belt as a
# result)....
#
# 4. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 1996-05-08 No. 575
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P960000575_
# amends the 1992-01-13 act to end summer time in October instead
# of September, mirroring identical Russian change from 1996-04-23 act.
#
# 5. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 1999-03-26 No. 305
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P990000305_
# cancels the extra hour ("decree time") for Atyraū oblast since the
# last Sunday of March 1999 while retaining the oblast in the fourth
# time belt.
#
# This means change from +05/+06 to +04/+05....
#
# 6. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 2000-11-23 No. 1749
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/archive/docs/P000001749_/23.11.2000
# replaces the previous five documents.
#
# The only changes I noticed are in definition of the border between the
# fourth and the fifth time belts.  They account for changes in spelling
# and administrative division (splitting of Turgai oblast in 1997
# probably changed time in territories incorporated into Qostanay oblast
# (including Arkalyk) from +06/+07 to +05/+06) and move Qyzylorda oblast
# from being in the fifth time belt and not using decree time into the
# fourth time belt (no change in practice).
#
# 7. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 2003-12-29 No. 1342
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P030001342_
# modified the 2000-11-23 act.  No relevant changes, apparently.
#
# 8. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 2004-07-20 No. 775
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/archive/docs/P040000775_/20.07.2004
# modified the 2000-11-23 act to move Qostanay and Qyzylorda oblasts into
# the fifth time belt and add Aktobe oblast to the list of regions not
# using extra hour ("decree time"), leaving Kazakhstan with only 2 time
# zones (+04/+05 and +06/+07).  The changes were to be implemented
# during DST transitions in 2004 and 2005 but the acts got radically
# amended before implementation happened.
#
# 9. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 2004-09-15 No. 1059
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P040001059_
# modified the 2000-11-23 act to remove exceptions from the "decree time"
# (leaving Kazakhstan in +05/+06 and +06/+07 zones), amended the
# 2004-07-20 act to implement changes for Atyraū, West Kazakhstan,
# Qostanay, Qyzylorda and Mangghystaū oblasts by not moving clocks
# during the 2004 transition to "winter" time.
#
# This means transition from +04/+05 to +05/+06 for Atyraū oblast (no
# zone currently), Asia/Oral, Asia/Aqtau and transition from +05/+06 to
# +06/+07 for Qostanay oblast (Qostanay and Arkalyk, no zones currently)
# and Asia/Qyzylorda on 2004-10-31 at 3:00....
#
# 10. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 2005-03-15 No. 231
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P050000231_
# removes DST provisions from the 2000-11-23 act, removes most of the
# (already implemented) provisions from the 2004-07-20 and 2004-09-15
# acts, comes into effect 10 days after official publication.
# The only practical effect seems to be the abolition of the summer
# time.
#
# Unamended version of the act of the Government of the Russian Federation
# No. 23 from 1992-01-08 [See 'europe' file for details].
# Kazakh 1992-01-13 act appears to provide the same rules and 1992-03-27
# act was to be enacted on the last Sunday of March 1992.

# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-11-08):
# Turgai reorganization should affect only southern part of Qostanay
# oblast.  Which should probably be separated into Asia/Arkalyk zone.
# (There were also 1970, 1988 and 1990 Turgai oblast reorganizations
# according to wikipedia.)
#
# [For Qostanay] http://www.ng.kz/gazeta/195/hranit/
# suggests that clocks were to be moved 40 minutes backwards on
# 1920-01-01 to the fourth time belt.  But I do not understand
# how that could happen....
#
# [For Atyrau and Oral] 1919 decree
# (http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_russia-1919-02-08.html
# and in Byalokoz) lists Ural river (plus 10 versts on its left bank) in
# the third time belt (before 1930 this means +03).

# From Alexander Konzurovski (2018-12-20):
# (Asia/Qyzylorda) is changing its time zone from UTC+6 to UTC+5
# effective December 21st, 2018....

# From Paul Eggert (2016-08-23):
# The Korean Wikipedia entry gives the following sources for UT offsets:
#
# 1908: Official Journal Article No. 3994 (decree No. 5)
# 1912: Governor-General of Korea Official Gazette Issue No. 367

# (Another source "1987: Law No. 3919 (1986-12-31)" was in the 2014-10-30
# edition of the Korean Wikipedia entry.)
#
# I guessed that time zone abbreviations through 1945 followed the same
# rules as discussed under Taiwan, with nominal switches from JST to KST
# when the respective cities were taken over by the Allies after WWII.
#
# For Pyongyang, guess no changes from World War II until 2015, as we
# have no information otherwise.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2015-08-07):
# According to many news sources, North Korea is going to change to

# There is no common English-language abbreviation for this time zone.
# Use KST, as that's what we already use for 1954-1961 in ROK.

# Lebanon
#
# From Saadallah Itani (2023-03-23):
# Lebanon ... announced today delay of Spring forward from March 25 to April 20.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2023-03-27):
# This announcement was by the Lebanese caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati.
# https://www.mtv.com.lb/en/News/Local/1352516/lebanon-postpones-daylight-saving-time-adoption
# A video was later leaked to the media of parliament speaker Nabih Berri
# asking Mikati to postpone DST to aid observance of Ramadan, Mikati objecting
# that this would cause problems such as scheduling airline flights, to which
# Berri interjected, "What flights?"
#
# The change was controversial and led to a partly-sectarian divide.
# Many Lebanese institutions, including the education ministry, the Maronite
# church, and two news channels LCBI and MTV, ignored the announcement and
# went ahead with the long-scheduled spring-forward on March 25/26, some
# arguing that the prime minister had not followed the law because the change
# had not been approved by the cabinet.  Google went with the announcement;
# Apple ignored it.  At least one bank followed the announcement for its doors,
# but ignored the announcement in internal computer systems.
# Beirut international airport listed two times for each departure.
# Dan Azzi wrote "My view is that this whole thing is a Dumb and Dumber movie."
# Eventually the prime minister backed down, said the cabinet had decided to
# stick with its 1998 decision, and that DST would begin midnight March 29/30.
# https://www.nna-leb.gov.lb/en/miscellaneous/604093/lebanon-has-two-times-of-day-amid-daylight-savings
# https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/27/lebanon-in-two-different-time-zones-as-government-disagrees-on-daylight-savings.html
#
# Although we could model the chaos with two Zones, that would likely cause
# more trouble than it would cure.  Since so many manual clocks and
# computer-based timestamps ignored the announcement, stick with official
# cabinet resolutions in the data while recording the prime minister's
# announcement as a comment.  This is how we treated a similar situation in
# Rio de Janeiro in spring 1993.

# Mongolia

# Shanks & Pottenger say that Mongolia has three time zones, but
# The USNO (1995-12-21) and the CIA map Standard Time Zones of the World
# (2005-03) both say that it has just one.

# From Oscar van Vlijmen (1999-12-11):
# General Information Mongolia
# <http://www.mongoliatourism.gov.mn/general.htm> (1999-09)
# "Time: Mongolia has two time zones. Three westernmost provinces of
# Bayan-Ölgii, Uvs, and Hovd are one hour earlier than the capital city, and
# the rest of the country follows the Ulaanbaatar time, which is UTC/GMT plus
# eight hours."

# From Rives McDow (1999-12-13):
# Mongolia discontinued the use of daylight savings time in 1999; 1998
# being the last year it was implemented.  The dates of implementation I am
# unsure of, but most probably it was similar to Russia, except for the time
# of implementation may have been different....
# Some maps in the past have indicated that there was an additional time
# zone in the eastern part of Mongolia, including the provinces of Dornod,
# Sükhbaatar, and possibly Khentii.

# From Paul Eggert (1999-12-15):
# Naming and spelling is tricky in Mongolia.
# We'll use Hovd (also spelled Chovd and Khovd) to represent the west zone;
# the capital of the Hovd province is sometimes called Hovd, sometimes Dund-Us,
# and sometimes Jirgalanta (with variant spellings), but the name Hovd
# is good enough for our purposes.

# From Rives McDow (2001-05-13):
# In addition to Mongolia starting daylight savings as reported earlier
# (adopted DST on 2001-04-27 02:00 local time, ending 2001-09-28),
# there are three time zones.
#
# Provinces [at 7:00]: Bayan-Ölgii, Uvs, Khovd, Zavkhan, Govi-Altai
# Provinces [at 8:00]: Khövsgöl, Bulgan, Arkhangai, Khentii, Töv,
#	Bayankhongor, Övörkhangai, Dundgovi, Dornogovi, Ömnögovi
# Provinces [at 9:00]: Dornod, Sükhbaatar
#
# [The province of Selenge is omitted from the above lists.]

# From Ganbold Ts., Ulaanbaatar (2004-04-17):
# Daylight saving occurs at 02:00 local time last Saturday of March.
# It will change back to normal at 02:00 local time last Saturday of
# September.... As I remember this rule was changed in 2001.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2004-04-17):
# For now, assume Rives McDow's informant got confused about Friday vs
# Saturday, and that his 2001 dates should have 1 added to them.

# From Paul Eggert (2005-07-26):
# We have wildly conflicting information about Mongolia's time zones.
# Bill Bonnet (2005-05-19) reports that the US Embassy in Ulaanbaatar says
# there is only one time zone and that DST is observed, citing Microsoft
# Windows XP as the source.  Risto Nykänen (2005-05-16) reports that
# travelmongolia.org says there are two time zones (UT +07, +08) with no DST.
# Oscar van Vlijmen (2005-05-20) reports that the Mongolian Embassy in
# Washington, DC says there are two time zones, with DST observed.
# He also found
# http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/index.php?subaction=showcomments&id=1111634894&archive=&start_from=&ucat=1&
# which also says that there is DST, and which has a comment by "Toddius"
# (2005-03-31 06:05 +0700) saying "Mongolia actually has 3.5 time zones.
# The West (OLGII) is +7 GMT, most of the country is ULAT is +8 GMT
# and some Eastern provinces are +9 GMT but Sükhbaatar Aimag is SUHK +8.5 GMT.
# The SUKH timezone is new this year, it is one of the few things the
# parliament passed during the tumultuous winter session."
# For now, let's ignore this information, until we have more confirmation.

# From Ganbold Ts. (2007-02-26):
# Parliament of Mongolia has just changed the daylight-saving rule in February.
# They decided not to adopt daylight-saving time....
# http://www.mongolnews.mn/index.php?module=unuudur&sec=view&id=15742

# From Deborah Goldsmith (2008-03-30):
# We received a bug report claiming that the tz database UTC offset for
# Asia/Choibalsan (GMT+09:00) is incorrect, and that it should be GMT
# +08:00 instead. Different sources appear to disagree with the tz
# database on this, e.g.:
#
# https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=1026
# http://www.worldtimeserver.com/current_time_in_MN.aspx
#
# both say GMT+08:00.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-03-31):
# eznis airways, which operates several domestic flights, has a flight
# schedule here:
# http://www.eznis.com/Container.jsp?id=112
# (click the English flag for English)
#
# There it appears that flights between Choibalsan and Ulaanbaatar arrive
# about 1:35 - 1:50 hours later in local clock time, no matter the
# direction, while Ulaanbaatar-Khovd takes 2 hours in the Eastern
# direction and 3:35 back, which indicates that Ulaanbaatar and Khovd are
# in different time zones (like we know about), while Choibalsan and
# Ulaanbaatar are in the same time zone (correction needed).

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-05-19):
# Assume that Choibalsan is indeed offset by 8:00.
# XXX--in the absence of better information, assume that transition
# was at the start of 2008-03-31 (the day of Steffen Thorsen's report);
# this is almost surely wrong.

# From Ganbold Tsagaankhuu (2015-03-10):
# It seems like yesterday Mongolian Government meeting has concluded to use
# daylight saving time in Mongolia....  Starting at 2:00AM of last Saturday of
# March 2015, daylight saving time starts.  And 00:00AM of last Saturday of
# September daylight saving time ends.  Source:

# Pakistan

# From Rives McDow (2002-03-13):
# I have been advised that Pakistan has decided to adopt dst on a
# TRIAL basis for one year, starting 00:01 local time on April 7, 2002
# and ending at 00:01 local time October 6, 2002.  This is what I was
# told, but I believe that the actual time of change may be 00:00; the
# 00:01 was to make it clear which day it was on.

# From Paul Eggert (2002-03-15):
# Jesper Nørgaard found this URL:
# http://www.pak.gov.pk/public/news/app/app06_dec.htm
# (dated 2001-12-06) which says that the Cabinet adopted a scheme "to
# advance the clocks by one hour on the night between the first
# Saturday and Sunday of April and revert to the original position on
# 15th October each year".  This agrees with McDow's 04-07 at 00:00,
# but disagrees about the October transition, and makes it sound like
# it's not on a trial basis.  Also, the "between the first Saturday
# and Sunday of April" phrase, if taken literally, means that the
# transition takes place at 00:00 on the first Sunday on or after 04-02.

# From Paul Eggert (2003-02-09):
# DAWN <http://www.dawn.com/2002/10/06/top13.htm> reported on 2002-10-05

# Palestine

# From Amos Shapir (1998-02-15):
#
# From 1917 until 1948-05-15, all of Palestine, including the parts now
# known as the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, was under British rule.
# Therefore the rules given for Israel for that period, apply there too...
#
# The Gaza Strip was under Egyptian rule between 1948-05-15 until 1967-06-05
# (except a short occupation by Israel from 1956-11 till 1957-03, but no
# time zone was affected then).  It was never formally annexed to Egypt,
# though.
#
# The rest of Palestine was under Jordanian rule at that time, formally
# annexed in 1950 as the West Bank (and the word "Trans" was dropped from
# the country's previous name of "the Hashemite Kingdom of the
# Trans-Jordan").  So the rules for Jordan for that time apply.  Major
# towns in that area are Nablus (Shchem), El-Halil (Hebron), Ramallah, and
# East Jerusalem.
#
# Both areas were occupied by Israel in June 1967, but not annexed (except
# for East Jerusalem).  They were on Israel time since then; there might
# have been a Military Governor's order about time zones, but I'm not aware
# of any (such orders may have been issued semi-annually whenever summer
# time was in effect, but maybe the legal aspect of time was just neglected).
#
# The Palestinian Authority was established in 1993, and got hold of most
# towns in the West Bank and Gaza by 1995.  I know that in order to
# demonstrate...independence, they have been switching to
# summer time and back on a different schedule than Israel's, but I don't
# know when this was started, or what algorithm is used (most likely the

# To summarize, the table should probably look something like that:

#
# I guess more info may be available from the PA's web page (if/when they
# have one).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Shanks & Pottenger write that Gaza did not observe DST until 1957, but go
# with Shapir and assume that it observed DST from 1940 through 1947,
# and that it used Jordanian rules starting in 1996.
# We don't yet need a separate entry for the West Bank, since
# the only differences between it and Gaza that we know about
# occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
# However, as we get more information, we may need to add entries
# for parts of the West Bank as they transitioned from Israel's rules
# to Palestine's rules.

# From IINS News Service - Israel - 1998-03-23 10:38:07 Israel time,
# forwarded by Ephraim Silverberg:
#
# Despite the fact that Israel changed over to daylight savings time
# last week, the PLO Authority (PA) has decided not to turn its clocks
# one-hour forward at this time.  As a sign of independence from Israeli rule,
# the PA has decided to implement DST in April.

# From Paul Eggert (1999-09-20):
# Daoud Kuttab writes in Holiday havoc
# http://www.jpost.com/com/Archive/22.Apr.1999/Opinion/Article-2.html
# (Jerusalem Post, 1999-04-22) that
# the Palestinian National Authority changed to DST on 1999-04-15.
# I vaguely recall that they switch back in October (sorry, forgot the source).
# For now, let's assume that the spring switch was at 24:00,
# and that they switch at 0:00 on the 3rd Fridays of April and October.

# From Paul Eggert (2005-11-22):
# Starting 2004 transitions are from Steffen Thorsen's web site timeanddate.com.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2005-11-23):
# A user from Gaza reported that Gaza made the change early because of
# the Ramadan.  Next year Ramadan will be even earlier, so I think
# there is a good chance next year's end date will be around two weeks
# earlier - the same goes for Jordan.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2006-08-17):
# I was informed by a user in Bethlehem that in Bethlehem it started the
# same day as Israel, and after checking with other users in the area, I
# was informed that they started DST one day after Israel.  I was not
# able to find any authoritative sources at the time, nor details if
# Gaza changed as well, but presumed Gaza to follow the same rules as
# the West Bank.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2006-09-26):
# according to the Palestine News Network (2006-09-19):
# http://english.pnn.ps/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=596&Itemid=5
# > The Council of Ministers announced that this year its winter schedule
# > will begin early, as of midnight Thursday.  It is also time to turn
# > back the clocks for winter.  Friday will begin an hour late this week.
# I guess it is likely that next year's date will be moved as well,
# because of the Ramadan.

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2007-09-18):
# According to Steffen Thorsen's web site the Gaza Strip and the rest of the
# Palestinian territories left DST early on 13.th. of September at 2:00.

# From Paul Eggert (2007-09-20):
# My understanding is that Gaza and the West Bank disagree even over when
# the weekend is (Thursday+Friday versus Friday+Saturday), so I'd be a bit
# surprised if they agreed about DST.  But for now, assume they agree.
# For lack of better information, predict that future changes will be
# the 2nd Thursday of September at 02:00.

# to DST at 02:00 the first Saturday after Ramadan, and that
# if the normal spring-forward or fall-back transition occurs during
# Ramadan the former is delayed and the latter advanced.
# To implement this, I predicted Ramadan-oriented transition dates for
# 2023 through 2086 by running the following program under GNU Emacs 28.2,
# with the results integrated by hand into the table below.
# Predictions after 2086 are approximated without Ramadan.

# From Paul Eggert (2018-11-18):
# The Spanish initially used American (west-of-Greenwich) time.
# It is unknown what time Manila kept when the British occupied it from
# 1762-10-06 through 1764-04; for now assume it kept American time.
# On 1844-08-16, Narciso Clavería, governor-general of the
# Philippines, issued a proclamation announcing that 1844-12-30 was to
# be immediately followed by 1845-01-01; see R.H. van Gent's
# History of the International Date Line
# https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/idl/idl_philippines.htm

# [a story dated 2006-04-25 by Cris Larano of Dow Jones Newswires,
# but no details]

# From Paul Eggert (2014-08-14):
# The following source says DST may be instituted November-January and again
# March-June, but this is not definite.  It also says DST was last proclaimed
# during the Ramos administration (1992-1998); but again, no details.
# Carcamo D. PNoy urged to declare use of daylight saving time.
# Philippine Star 2014-08-05
# http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/08/05/1354152/pnoy-urged-declare-use-daylight-saving-time

# From Paul Goyette (2018-06-15):
# In the Philippines, there is a national law, Republic Act No. 10535
# which declares the official time here as "Philippine Standard Time".
# The act [1] even specifies use of PST as the abbreviation, although
# the FAQ provided by PAGASA [2] uses the "acronym PhST to distinguish
# it from the Pacific Standard Time (PST)."

# [2] https://www1.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/index.php/astronomy/philippine-standard-time#republic-act-10535
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-06-19):
# I surveyed recent news reports, and my impression is that "PST" is
# more popular among reliable English-language news sources.  This is
# not just a measure of Google hit counts: it's also the sizes and
# influence of the sources.  There is no current abbreviation for DST,
# so use "PDT", the usual American style.

# Japan's year-round bases in Antarctica match this since 1970.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-08-29):
# Time in Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Arabian peninsula was not
# standardized until 1968 or so; we don't know exactly when, and possibly it
# has never been made official.  Richard P Hunt, in "Islam city yielding to
# modern times", New York Times (1961-04-09), p 20, wrote that only airlines
# observed standard time, and that people in Jeddah mostly observed quasi-solar
# time, doing so by setting their watches at sunrise to 6 o'clock (or to 12
# o'clock for "Arab" time).
#
# Timekeeping differed depending on who you were and which part of Saudi
# Arabia you were in.  In 1969, Elias Antar wrote that although a common
# practice had been to set one's watch to 12:00 (i.e., midnight) at sunset -
# which meant that the time on one side of a mountain could differ greatly from
# the time on the other side - many foreigners set their watches to 6pm
# instead, while airlines instead used UTC +03 (except in Dhahran, where they
# used UTC +04), Aramco used UTC +03 with DST, and the Trans-Arabian Pipe Line
# Company used Aramco time in eastern Saudi Arabia and airline time in western.
# (The American Military Aid Advisory Group used plain UTC.)  Antar writes,
# "A man named Higgins, so the story goes, used to run a local power
# station. One day, the whole thing became too much for Higgins and he
# assembled his staff and laid down the law. 'I've had enough of this,' he
# shrieked. 'It is now 12 o'clock Higgins Time, and from now on this station is
# going to run on Higgins Time.' And so, until last year, it did."  See:
# Antar E. Dinner at When? Saudi Aramco World, 1969 March/April. 2-3.
# http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/196902/dinner.at.when.htm
# Also see: Antar EN. Arabian flying is confusing.
# Port Angeles (WA) Evening News. 1965-03-10. page 3.
#
# The TZ database cannot represent quasi-solar time; airline time is the best
# we can do.  The 1946 foreign air news digest of the U.S. Civil Aeronautics
# Board (OCLC 42299995) reported that the "... Arabian Government, inaugurated
# a weekly Dhahran-Cairo service, via the Saudi Arabian cities of Riyadh and
# Jidda, on March 14, 1947".  Shanks & Pottenger guessed 1950; go with the
# earlier date.
#
# Shanks & Pottenger also state that until 1968-05-01 Saudi Arabia had two
# time zones; the other zone, at UT +04, was in the far eastern part of
# the country.  Presumably this is documenting airline time.  Ignore this,
# as it's before our 1970 cutoff.

# From Paul Eggert (2013-02-21):
# Milne says "Madras mean time use from May 1, 1898.  Prior to this Colombo
# mean time, 5h. 4m. 21.9s. F., was used."  But 5:04:21.9 differs considerably
# from Colombo's meridian 5:19:24, so for now ignore Milne and stick with
# Shanks and Pottenger.

# From Paul Eggert (1996-09-03):
# "Sri Lanka advances clock by an hour to avoid blackout"
# (<http://www.virtual-pc.com/lankaweb/news/items/240596-2.html>, 1996-05-24,
# no longer available as of 1999-08-17)
# reported "the country's standard time will be put forward by one hour at
# midnight Friday (1830 GMT) 'in the light of the present power crisis'."
#
# From Dharmasiri Senanayake, Sri Lanka Media Minister (1996-10-24), as quoted
# by Shamindra in Daily News - Hot News Section
# <news:54rka5$m5h@mtinsc01-mgt.ops.worldnet.att.net> (1996-10-26):
# With effect from 12.30 a.m. on 26th October 1996
# Sri Lanka will be six (06) hours ahead of GMT.

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2006-04-14), quoting Sri Lanka News Online
# <http://news.sinhalaya.com/wmview.php?ArtID=11002> (2006-04-13):
# 0030 hrs on April 15, 2006 (midnight of April 14, 2006 +30 minutes)
# at present, become 2400 hours of April 14, 2006 (midnight of April 14, 2006).

# From Peter Apps and Ranga Sirila of Reuters (2006-04-12) in:
# http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=scienceNews&storyID=2006-04-12T172228Z_01_COL295762_RTRIDST_0_SCIENCE-SRILANKA-TIME-DC.XML
# [The Tamil Tigers] never accepted the original 1996 time change and simply
# kept their clocks set five and a half hours ahead of Greenwich Mean
# Time (GMT), in line with neighbor India.
# From Paul Eggert (2006-04-18):
# People who live in regions under Tamil control can use [TZ='Asia/Kolkata'],
# as that zone has agreed with the Tamil areas since our cutoff date of 1970.

# From Sadika Sumanapala (2016-10-19):
# According to http://www.sltime.org (maintained by Measurement Units,
# Standards & Services Department, Sri Lanka) abbreviation for Sri Lanka
# standard time is SLST.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2016-10-18):
# "SLST" seems to be reasonably recent and rarely used outside time
# zone nerd sources.  I searched Google News and found three uses of
# it in the International Business Times of India in February and
# March of this year when discussing cricket match times, but nothing
# since then (though there has been a lot of cricket) and nothing in
# other English-language news sources.  Our old abbreviation "LKT" is
# even worse.  For now, let's use a numeric abbreviation; we can
# switch to "SLST" if it catches on.

# http://www.sana.sy/ara/2/2009/09/29/247012.htm (Arabic)

# From Arthur David Olson (2009-10-28):
# We'll see if future DST switching times turn out to be end of the last
# Thursday of the month or the start of the last Friday of the month or
# something else. For now, use the start of the last Friday.

# The "Syrian News Station" reported on 2010-03-16 that the Council of
# Ministers has decided that Syria will start DST on midnight Thursday
# 2010-04-01: (midnight between Thursday and Friday):

# Syria is adopting year-round DST, starting this autumn....
# From https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/607812
# "This [the decision] came after the weekly government meeting today,
# Tuesday 4 October ..."

# From Paul Eggert (2022-10-05):
# Like Jordan, model this as a transition from EEST +03 (DST) to plain +03
# (non-DST) at the point where DST would otherwise have ended.

# Vietnam (southern)

# From Paul Eggert (2014-10-04):
# Milne gives 7:16:56 for the meridian of Saigon in 1899, as being
# used in Lower Laos, Cambodia, and Annam.  But this is quite a ways
# from Saigon's location.  For now, ignore this and stick with Shanks
# and Pottenger for LMT before 1906.

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-03-18):
# The English-language name of Vietnam's most populous city is "Ho Chi Minh
# City"; use Ho_Chi_Minh below to avoid a name of more than 14 characters.

# From Paul Eggert (2022-07-27) after a 2014 heads-up from Trần Ngọc Quân:
# Trần Tiến Bình's authoritative book "Lịch Việt Nam: thế kỷ XX-XXI (1901-2100)"
# (Nhà xuất bản Văn Hoá - Thông Tin, Hanoi, 2005), pp 49-50,
# is quoted verbatim in:
# http://www.thoigian.com.vn/?mPage=P80D01
# is translated by Brian Inglis in:
# https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2014-October/021654.html
# and is the basis for the information below.
#
# The 1906 transition was effective July 1 and standardized Indochina to
# Phù Liễn Observatory, legally 104° 17' 17" east of Paris.
# It's unclear whether this meant legal Paris Mean Time (00:09:21) or
# the Paris Meridian; for now guess the former and round the exact
# 07:06:30.1333... to 07:06:30.13 as the legal spec used 66 2/3 ms precision.
# which is used below even though the modern-day Phù Liễn Observatory
# is closer to 07:06:31.  Abbreviate Phù Liễn Mean Time as PLMT.
#
# The following transitions occurred in Indochina in general (before 1954)
# and in South Vietnam in particular (after 1954):
# To 07:00 on 1911-05-01.
# To 08:00 on 1942-12-31 at 23:00.
# To 09:00 on 1945-03-14 at 23:00.
# To 07:00 on 1945-09-02 in Vietnam.
# To 08:00 on 1947-04-01 in French-controlled Indochina.
# To 07:00 on 1955-07-01 in South Vietnam.
# To 08:00 on 1959-12-31 at 23:00 in South Vietnam.
# To 07:00 on 1975-06-13 in South Vietnam.

# From Paul Eggert (2019-02-19):
#
# The Ho Chi Minh entry suffices for most purposes as it agrees with all of
# Vietnam since 1975-06-13.  Presumably clocks often changed in south Vietnam
# in the early 1970s as locations changed hands during the war; however the
# details are unknown and would likely be too voluminous for this database.
#
# For timestamps in north Vietnam back to 1970 (the tzdb cutoff),
# use Asia/Bangkok; see the VN entries in the file zone1970.tab.
# For timestamps before 1970, see Asia/Hanoi in the file 'backzone'.
# tzdb data for Australasia and environs, and for much of the Pacific

# This file is in the public domain, so clarified as of
# 2009-05-17 by Arthur David Olson.

# This file also includes Pacific islands.

# Queensland
#
# From Alex Livingston (1996-11-01):
# I have heard or read more than once that some resort islands off the coast
# of Queensland chose to keep observing daylight-saving time even after
# Queensland ceased to.
#
# From Paul Eggert (1996-11-22):
# IATA SSIM (1993-02/1994-09) say that the Holiday Islands (Hayman, Lindeman,
# Hamilton) observed DST for two years after the rest of Queensland stopped.
# Hamilton is the largest, but there is also a Hamilton in Victoria,
# so use Lindeman.
#
# From J William Piggott (2016-02-20):
# There is no location named Holiday Islands in Queensland Australia; holiday
# islands is a colloquial term used globally.  Hayman and Lindeman are at the
# north and south extremes of the Whitsunday Islands archipelago, and
# Hamilton is in between; it is reasonable to believe that this time zone
# applies to all of the Whitsundays.

# For now, guess DST from 02:00 the second Sunday in November to 03:00
# the first Sunday on or after January 12.  January transitions reportedly
# depend on when school terms start.  Although the guess is ad hoc, it matches
# transitions planned this year and seems more likely to match future practice

# In a 2021-10-10 speech concerning updated Covid-19 mitigation measures in

# suspension of DST for the 2021/2022 season: "Given that we are in the process

# Savings Time on hold for this year. It will also make the reopening of

# concerned shifting arrival and departure times, which may look like a simple
# thing but requires some significant logistical adjustments domestically and

# US minor outlying islands

# Howland, Baker
# Howland was mined for guano by American companies 1857-1878 and British
# 1886-1891; Baker was similar but exact dates are not known.
# Inhabited by civilians 1935-1942; U.S. military bases 1943-1944;
# uninhabited thereafter.
# Howland observed Hawaii Standard Time (UT -10:30) in 1937;
# see page 206 of Elgen M. Long and Marie K. Long,
# Amelia Earhart: the Mystery Solved, Simon & Schuster (2000).
# So most likely Howland and Baker observed Hawaii Time from 1935

# Johnston
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-02-10):
# Sometimes Johnston kept Hawaii time, and sometimes it was an hour behind.
# Details are uncertain.  We have no data for Johnston after 1970, so
# treat it like Hawaii for now.  Since Johnston is now uninhabited,
# its link to Pacific/Honolulu is in the 'backward' file.
#
# In his memoirs of June 6th to October 4, 1945
# <http://www.315bw.org/Herb_Bach.htm> (2005), Herbert C. Bach writes,
# "We started our letdown to Kwajalein Atoll and landed there at 5:00 AM
# Johnston time, 1:30 AM Kwajalein time."  This was in June 1945, and
# confirms that Johnston kept the same time as Honolulu in summer 1945.
#
# From Lyle McElhaney (2014-03-11):
# [W]hen JI was being used for that [atomic bomb] testing, the time being used
# was not Hawaiian time but rather the same time being used on the ships,
# which had a GMT offset of -11 hours.  This apparently applied to at least the
# time from Operation Newsreel (Hardtack I/Teak shot, 1958-08-01) to the last
# Operation Fishbowl shot (Tightrope, 1962-11-04).... [See] Herman Hoerlin,
# "The United States High-Altitude Test Experience: A Review Emphasizing the
# Impact on the Environment", Los Alamos LA-6405, Oct 1976.
# https://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/docs1/00322994.pdf
# See the table on page 4 where he lists GMT and local times for the tests; a
# footnote for the JI tests reads that local time is "JI time = Hawaii Time
# Minus One Hour".

# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
# Daylight saving time has long been controversial in Australia, pitting
# region against region, rural against urban, and local against global.
# For example, in her review of Graeme Davison's _The Unforgiving
# Minute: how Australians learned to tell the time_ (1993), Perth native
# Phillipa J Martyr wrote, "The section entitled 'Saving Daylight' was
# very informative, but was (as can, sadly, only be expected from a
# Melbourne-based study) replete with the usual chuckleheaded
# Queenslanders and straw-chewing yokels from the West prattling fables
# about fading curtains and crazed farm animals."

# Implementation Dates of Daylight Saving Time within Australia
# http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/dst_times.shtml
# summarizes daylight saving issues in Australia.

# From Arthur David Olson (2005-12-12):
# Lawlink NSW:Daylight Saving in New South Wales
# http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/Corporate/ll_agdinfo.nsf/pages/community_relations_daylight_saving
# covers New South Wales in particular.

# From John Mackin (1991-03-06):
# We in Australia have _never_ referred to DST as 'daylight' time.
# It is called 'summer' time.  Now by a happy coincidence, 'summer'
# and 'standard' happen to start with the same letter; hence, the
# abbreviation does _not_ change...
# The legislation does not actually define abbreviations, at least
# in this State, but the abbreviation is just commonly taken to be the
# initials of the phrase, and the legislation here uniformly uses
# the phrase 'summer time' and does not use the phrase 'daylight
# time'.
# Announcers on the Commonwealth radio network, the ABC (for Australian
# Broadcasting Commission), use the phrases 'Eastern Standard Time'
# or 'Eastern Summer Time'.  (Note, though, that as I say in the
# current australasia file, there is really no such thing.)  Announcers
# on its overseas service, Radio Australia, use the same phrases
# prefixed by the word 'Australian' when referring to local times;
# time announcements on that service, naturally enough, are made in UTC.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
#
# Inspired by Mackin's remarks quoted above, earlier versions of this
# file used "EST" for both Eastern Standard Time and Eastern Summer
# Time in Australia, and similarly for "CST", "CWST", and "WST".
# However, these abbreviations were confusing and were not common
# practice among Australians, and there were justifiable complaints
# about them, so I attempted to survey current Australian usage.
# For the tz database, the full English phrase is not that important;
# what matters is the abbreviation.  It's difficult to survey the web
# directly for abbreviation usage, as there are so many false hits for
# strings like "EST" and "EDT", so I looked for pages that defined an
# abbreviation for eastern or central DST in Australia, and got the
# following numbers of unique hits for the listed Google queries:
#
#   10 "Eastern Daylight Time AEST" site:au [some are false hits]
#   10 "Eastern Summer Time AEST" site:au
#   10 "Summer Time AEDT" site:au
#   13 "EDST Eastern Daylight Saving Time" site:au
#   18 "Summer Time ESST" site:au
#   28 "Eastern Daylight Saving Time EDST" site:au
#   39 "EDT Eastern Daylight Time" site:au [some are false hits]
#   53 "Eastern Daylight Time EDT" site:au [some are false hits]
#   54 "AEDT Australian Eastern Daylight Time" site:au
#  182 "Eastern Daylight Time AEDT" site:au
#
#   17 "Central Daylight Time CDT" site:au [some are false hits]
#   46 "Central Daylight Time ACDT" site:au
#
# I tried several other variants (e.g., "Eastern Summer Time EST") but
# they all returned fewer than 10 unique hits.  I also looked for pages
# mentioning both "western standard time" and an abbreviation, since
# there is no WST in the US to generate false hits, and found:
#
#  156 "western standard time" AWST site:au
#  226 "western standard time" WST site:au
#
# I then surveyed the top ten newspapers in Australia by circulation as
# listed in Wikipedia, using Google queries like "AEDT site:heraldsun.com.au"
# and obtaining estimated counts from the initial page of search results.
# All ten papers greatly preferred "AEDT" to "EDT".  The papers
# surveyed were the Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph, The Courier-Mail,
# The Sydney Morning Herald, The West Australian, The Age, The Advertiser,
# The Australian, The Financial Review, and The Herald (Newcastle).

# I also searched for historical usage, to see whether abbreviations
# like "AEDT" are new.  A Trove search <http://trove.nla.gov.au/>
# found only one newspaper (The Canberra Times) with a house style
# dating back to the 1970s, I expect because other newspapers weren't
# fully indexed.  The Canberra Times strongly preferred abbreviations
# like "AEDT".  The first occurrence of "AEDT" was a World Weather
# column (1971-11-17, page 24), and of "ACDT" was a Scoreboard column
# (1993-01-24, p 16).  The style was the typical usage but was not
# strictly enforced; for example, "Welcome to the twilight zones ..."
# (1994-10-29, p 1) uses the abbreviations AEST/AEDT, CST/CDT, and
# WST, and goes on to say, "The confusion and frustration some feel
# about the lack of uniformity among Australia's six states and two
# territories has prompted one group to form its very own political
# party -- the Sydney-based Daylight Saving Extension Party."
#
# I also surveyed federal government sources.  They did not agree:

#   EST CST WST preferred for standard time; AEST AEDT ACST ACDT also used
#
#   The Transport Safety Bureau has an extensive series of accident reports,
#   and investigators seem to use whatever abbreviation they like.
#   Googling site:atsb.gov.au found the following number of unique hits:
#   311 "ESuT", 195 "EDT", 26 "AEDT", 83 "CSuT", 46 "CDT".
#   "_SuT" tended to appear in older reports, and "A_DT" tended to
#   appear in reports of events with international implications.
#
# From the above it appears that there is a working consensus in
# Australia to use trailing "DT" for daylight saving time; although
# some sources use trailing "SST" or "ST" or "SuT" they are by far in
# the minority.  The case for leading "A" is weaker, but since it
# seems to be preferred in the overall web and is preferred in all
# the leading newspaper websites and in many government departments,
# it has a stronger case than omitting the leading "A".  The current
# version of the database therefore uses abbreviations like "AEST" and
# "AEDT" for Australian time zones.

# From Rives McDow (2002-04-09):
# The most interesting region I have found consists of three towns on the

# Australia does not.  The two states are one and a half hours apart.  The
# residents decided to forget about this nonsense of changing the clock so
# much and set the local time 20 hours and 45 minutes from the
# international date line, or right in the middle of the time of South
# Australia and Western Australia....
#
# From Paul Eggert (2002-04-09):

# From Alex Livingston (2006-12-07):
# ... it was just on four years ago that I drove along the Eyre Highway,
# which passes through eastern Western Australia close to the southern
# coast of the continent.
#
# I paid particular attention to the time kept there. There can be no
# dispute that UTC+08:45 was considered "the time" from the border
# village just inside the border with South Australia to as far west
# as just east of Caiguna. There can also be no dispute that Eucla is
# the largest population centre in this zone....
#
# Now that Western Australia is observing daylight saving, the
# question arose whether this part of the state would follow suit. I
# just called the border village and confirmed that indeed they have,
# meaning that they are now observing UTC+09:45.
#
# (2006-12-09):
# I personally doubt that either experimentation with daylight saving
# in WA or its introduction in SA had anything to do with the genesis
# of this time zone.  My hunch is that it's been around since well
# before 1975.  I remember seeing it noted on road maps decades ago.

# "The time zone exists for about 340 kilometres and takes in the tiny
# roadhouse communities of Cocklebiddy, Madura, Eucla and Border Village."
# ... and an indication that the zone has definitely been in existence
# since before the 1970 cut-off of the database ...
# From Paul Eggert (2019-05-17):
# That ABC Esperance story by Christien de Garis also says:

# discussing his book "The Sun in the Church: Cathedrals as Solar

# in Melbourne, Australia.
#
# Apparently the shrine's main purpose is a beam of sunlight which
# illuminates a special spot on the floor at the 11th hour of the 11th day
# of the 11th month (Remembrance Day) every year in memory of Australia's
# fallen WWI soldiers.  And if you go there on Nov. 11, at 11am local time,
# you will indeed see the sunbeam illuminate the special spot at the
# expected time.
#
# However, that is only because of some special mirror contraption that had
# to be employed, since due to daylight savings time, the true solar time of
# the remembrance moment occurs one hour later (or earlier?).  Perhaps
# someone with more information on this jury-rig can tell us more.

# Based on law library research by John Mackin,

#	In Australia, time is not legislated federally, but rather by the

# Lord Howe Island is located off the New South Wales coast, and is half an

# From James Lonergan, Secretary, Lord Howe Island Board (2000-01-27):
# Lord Howe Island summer time in 2000/2001 will commence on the same
# date as the rest of NSW (i.e. 2000-08-27).  For your information the
# Lord Howe Island Board (controlling authority for the Island) is

# instead of only 30 minutes.  [Dependent] on the wishes of residents
# the Board may approach the NSW government to change the existing
# arrangements.  The starting date for summer time on the Island will
# however always coincide with the rest of NSW.

# introduced in NSW, the "changeover" time on the Island has been 02:00 as
# shown on clocks on LHI. I guess this means that for 30 minutes at the start
# of DST, LHI is actually 1 hour ahead of the rest of NSW.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):

# Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands and Marcus Island (Minami-Tori-shima)

# From Wakaba (2019-01-28) via Phake Nick:
# National Diet Library of Japan has several reports by Japanese Government
# officers that describe the time used in islands when they visited there.
# According to them (and other sources such as newspapers), standard time UTC
# + 10 (JST + 1) and DST UTC + 11 (JST + 2) was used until its return to Japan
# at 1968-06-26 00:00 JST.  The exact periods of DST are still unknown.
# I guessed Guam, Mariana, and Bonin and Marcus districts might have
# synchronized their DST periods, but reports imply they had their own
# decisions, i.e. there were three or more different time zones....
#
# https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/小笠原諸島の標準時

# From Phake Nick (2019-02-12):
# Because their last time change to return to Japanese time when they returned
# to Japanese rule was right before 1970, ... per the current tz database
# rule, the information doesn't warrant creation of a new timezone for Bonin
# Islands itself and is thus as an anecdotal note for interest purpose only.
# ... [The abovementioned link] described some special timekeeping phenomenon
# regarding Marcus island, another remote island currently owned by Japanese
# in the same administrative unit as Bonin Islands.  Many reports claim that
# the American coastal guard on the American quarter of the island use its own
# coastal guard time, and most sources describe the time as UTC+11, being two
# hours faster than JST used by some Japanese personnel on the island.  Some
# sites describe it as same as Wake Island/Guam time although it would be
# incorrect to be same as Guam.  And then in a few Japanese governmental
# report from 1980s (from National Institute of Information and Communications
# Technology) regarding the construction of VLBI facility on the Marcus
# Island, it claimed that there are three time standards being used on the
# island at the time which include not just JST (UTC+9) or [US]CG time
# (UTC+11) but also a JMSDF time (UTC+10) (Japan Maritime Self-Defense
# Force).  Unfortunately there are no other sources that mentioned such time
# and there are also no information on things like how the time was used.


# Fiji

# Howse writes (p 153) that in 1879 the British governor of Fiji
# enacted an ordinance standardizing the islands on Antipodean Time
# instead of the American system (which was one day behind).

# From Rives McDow (1998-10-08):
# Fiji will introduce DST effective 0200 local time, 1998-11-01
# until 0300 local time 1999-02-28.  Each year the DST period will
# be from the first Sunday in November until the last Sunday in February.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-01-08):
# IATA SSIM (1999-09) says DST ends 0100 local time.  Go with McDow.

# From the BBC World Service in
# http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/205226.stm (1998-10-31 16:03 UTC):
# The Fijian government says the main reasons for the time change is to
# improve productivity and reduce road accidents.... [T]he move is also
# intended to boost Fiji's ability to attract tourists to witness the dawning
# of the new millennium.

# Kiribati

# From Paul Eggert (1996-01-22):
# Today's _Wall Street Journal_ (page 1) reports that Kiribati
# "declared it the same day [throughout] the country as of Jan. 1, 1995"
# as part of the competition to be first into the 21st century.

# From Kerry Shetline (2018-02-03):
# December 31 was the day that was skipped, so that the transition
# would be from Friday December 30, 1994 to Sunday January 1, 1995.

# Kanton

# From Paul Eggert (2021-05-27):
# Kiribati's +13 timezone is represented by Kanton, its only populated
# island.  (It was formerly spelled "Canton", but Gilbertese lacks "C".)
# Kanton was settled on 1937-08-31 by two British radio operators
# <https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1937v02/d94>;
# Americans came the next year and built an airfield, partly to
# establish airline service and perhaps partly anticipating the
# next war.  Aside from the war, the airfield was used by commercial
# airlines until long-range jets became standard; although currently
# for emergency use only, China says it is considering rebuilding the
# airfield for high-end niche tourism.  Kanton has about two dozen
# people, caretakers who rotate in from the rest of Kiribati in 2-5
# year shifts, and who use some of the leftover structures
# <http://pipa.neaq.org/2012/06/images-of-kanton-island.html>.

# Kwajalein

# From an AP article (1993-08-22):
# "The nearly 3,000 Americans living on this remote Pacific atoll have a good
# excuse for not remembering Saturday night: there wasn't one.  Residents were
# going to bed Friday night and waking up Sunday morning because at midnight
# -- 8 A.M. Eastern daylight time on Saturday -- Kwajalein was jumping from
# one side of the international date line to the other."
# "In Marshall Islands, Friday is followed by Sunday", NY Times. 1993-08-22.
# https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/world/in-marshall-islands-friday-is-followed-by-sunday.html

# From Paul Eggert (2022-03-31):
# Phake Nick (2018-10-27) noted <https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/南洋群島の標準時>'s
# citation of a 1993 AP article published in the New York Times saying
# Kwajalein synchronized its day with the US mainland about 40 years earlier.
# However the AP article is vague and possibly wrong about this.  The article
# says the earlier switch was "about 40 years ago when the United States
# Army established a missile test range here".  However, the Kwajalein Test
# Center was established on 1960-10-01 and was run by the US Navy.  It was
# transferred to the US Army on 1964-07-01.  See "Seize the High Ground"
# <https://history.army.mil/html/books/070/70-88-1/cmhPub_70-88-1.pdf>.
# Given that Shanks was right on the money about the 1993 change, I'm inclined
# to take Shanks's word for the 1969 change unless we find better evidence.


# N Mariana Is, Guam

# From Phake Nick (2018-10-27):
# Guam Island was briefly annexed by Japan during ... year 1941-1944 ...
# however there are no detailed information about what time it use during that
# period.  It would probably be reasonable to assume Guam use GMT+9 during
# that period of time like the surrounding area.

# From Paul Eggert (2023-01-23):
# Howse writes (p 153) "The Spaniards, on the other hand, reached the
# Philippines and the Ladrones from America," and implies that the Ladrones
# (now called the Marianas) kept American date for quite some time.
# For now, we assume the Ladrones switched at the same time as the Philippines;
# see Asia/Manila.
#
# Use 1941-12-10 and 1944-07-31 for Guam WWII transitions, as the rough start
# and end of Japanese control of Agana.  We don't know whether the Northern
# Marianas followed Guam's DST rules from 1959 through 1977; for now, assume
# they did as that avoids the need for a separate zone due to our 1970 cutoff.
#
# US Public Law 106-564 (2000-12-23) made UT +10 the official standard time,
# under the name "Chamorro standard time".  There is no official abbreviation,
# but Congressman Robert A. Underwood, author of the bill that became law,
# wrote in a press release (2000-12-27) that he will seek the use of "ChST".

# See also the commentary for Micronesia.


# Marshall Is
# See the commentary for Micronesia.


# Micronesia (and nearby)

# From Paul Eggert (2018-11-18):
# Like the Ladrones (see Guam commentary), assume the Spanish East Indies
# kept American time until the Philippines switched at the end of 1844.

# From Paul Eggert (1999-10-29):
# The Federated States of Micronesia Visitors Board writes in
# The Federated States of Micronesia - Visitor Information (1999-01-26)
# http://www.fsmgov.org/info/clocks.html
# that Truk and Yap are UT +10, and Ponape and Kosrae are +11.
# We don't know when Kosrae switched from +12; assume January 1 for now.

# From Phake Nick (2018-10-27):
#
# From a Japanese wiki site https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/南洋群島の標準時
# ...
# For "Southern Islands" (modern region of Mariana + Palau + Federation of
# Micronesia + Marshall Islands):
#
# A 1906 Japanese magazine shown the Caroline Islands and Mariana Islands
# who was occupied by Germany at the time as GMT+10, together with the like
# of German New Guinea.  However there is a marking saying it have not been
# implemented (yet).  No further information after that were found.
#
# Japan invaded those islands in 1914, and records shows that they were
# instructed to use JST at the time.
#
# 1915 January telecommunication record on the Jaluit Atoll shows they use
# the meridian of 170E as standard time (GMT+11:20), which is similar to the
# longitude of the atoll.
# 1915 February record say the 170E standard time is to be used until
# February 9 noon, and after February 9 noon they are to use JST.
# However these are time used within the Japanese Military at the time and
# probably does not reflect the time used by local resident at the time (that
# is if they keep their own time back then)
#
# In January 1919 the occupying force issued a command that split the area
# into three different timezone with meridian of 135E, 150E, 165E (JST+0, +1,
# +2), and the command was to become effective from February 1 of the same
# year.  Despite the target of the command is still only for the occupying
# force itself, further publication have described the time as the standard
# time for the occupied area and thus it can probably be seen as such.
#  * Area that use meridian of 135E: Palau and Yap civil administration area
#    (Southern Islands Western Standard Time)
#  * Area that use meridian of 150E: Truk (Chuuk) and Saipan civil
#    administration area (Southern Islands Central Standard Time)
#  * Area that use meridian of 165E: Ponape (Pohnpei) and Jaluit civil
#    administration area (Southern Islands Eastern Standard Time).
#  * In the next few years Japanese occupation of those islands have been
#    formalized via League of Nation Mandate (South Pacific Mandate) and formal
#    governance structure have been established, these district [become
#    subprefectures] and timezone classification have been inherited as standard
#    time of the area.
#  * Saipan subprefecture include Mariana islands (exclude Guam which was
#    occupied by America at the time), Palau and Yap subprefecture rule the
#    Western Caroline Islands with 137E longitude as border, Truk and Ponape
#    subprefecture rule the Eastern Caroline Islands with 154E as border, Ponape
#    subprefecture also rule part of Marshall Islands to the west of 164E
#    starting from (1918?) and Jaluit subprefecture rule the rest of the
#    Marshall Islands.
#
# And then in year 1937, an announcement was made to change the time in the
# area into 2 timezones:
#  * Area that use meridian of 135E: area administered by Palau, Yap and
#    Saipan subprefecture (Southern Islands Western Standard Time)
#  * Area that use meridian of 150E: area administered by Truk (Chuuk),
#    Ponape (Pohnpei) and Jaluit subprefecture (Southern Islands Eastern
#    Standard Time)
#
# Another announcement issued in 1941 say that on April 1 that year,
# standard time of the Southern Islands would be changed to use the meridian
# of 135E (GMT+9), and thus abolishing timezone different within the area.
#
# Then Pacific theater of WWII started and Japan slowly lose control on the
# island.  The webpage I linked above contain no information during this
# period of time....
#
# After the end of WWII, in 1946 February, a document written by the
# (former?) Japanese military personnel describe there are 3 hours time
# different between Caroline islands time/Wake island time and the Chungking
# time, which would mean the time being used there at the time was GMT+10.
#
# After that, the area become Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands
# under American administration from year 1947.  The site listed some
# American/International books/maps/publications about time used in those
# area during this period of time but they doesn't seems to be reliable
# information so it would be the best if someone know where can more reliable
# information can be found.
#
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-11-18):
#
# For the above, use vague dates like "1914" and "1945" for transitions that
# plausibly exist but for which the details are not known.  The information
# for Wake is too sketchy to act on.
#
# The 1906 GMT+10 info about German-controlled islands might not have been
# done, so omit it from the data for now.
#
# The Jaluit info governs Kwajalein.


# Midway

# From Charles T O'Connor, KMTH DJ (1956),
# quoted in the KTMH section of the Radio Heritage Collection
# <http://radiodx.com/spdxr/KMTH.htm> (2002-12-31):
# For the past two months we've been on what is known as Daylight
# Saving Time.  This time has put us on air at 5am in the morning,
# your time down there in New Zealand.  Starting September 2, 1956
# we'll again go back to Standard Time.  This'll mean that we'll go to
# air at 6am your time.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2003-03-23):
# We don't know the date of that quote, but we'll guess they
# started DST on June 3.  Possibly DST was observed other years

# Nauru

# From Phake Nick (2018-10-31):
# Currently, the tz database say Nauru use LMT until 1921, and then

# However, a number of timezone map published in America/Japan back then
# showed its timezone as GMT+11 per https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/ナウルの標準時
# And it would also be nice if the 1921 transition date could be sourced.

# Pitcairn

# From Rives McDow (1999-11-08):
# A Proclamation was signed by the Governor of Pitcairn on the 27th March 1998
# with regard to Pitcairn Standard Time.  The Proclamation is as follows.
#
#	The local time for general purposes in the Islands shall be
#	Co-ordinated Universal time minus 8 hours and shall be known
#	as Pitcairn Standard Time.
#
# ... I have also seen Pitcairn listed as UTC minus 9 hours in several
# references, and can only assume that this was an error in interpretation
# somehow in light of this proclamation.

# From Rives McDow (1999-11-09):
# The Proclamation regarding Pitcairn time came into effect on 27 April 1998
# ... at midnight.

# From Howie Phelps (1999-11-10), who talked to a Pitcairner via shortwave:
# Betty Christian told me yesterday that their local time is the same as
# Pacific Standard Time. They used to be ½ hour different from us here in
# Sacramento but it was changed a couple of years ago.


# (Western) Samoa and American Samoa

# Howse writes (p 153) that after the 1879 standardization on Antipodean
# time by the British governor of Fiji, the King of Samoa decided to change
# "the date in his kingdom from the Antipodean to the American system,
# ordaining - by a masterpiece of diplomatic flattery - that
# the Fourth of July should be celebrated twice in that year."
# This happened in 1892, according to the Evening News (Sydney) of 1892-07-20.
# https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/idl/idl.htm

# Although Shanks & Pottenger says they both switched to UT -11:30
# in 1911, and to -11 in 1950. many earlier sources give -11
# for American Samoa, e.g., the US National Bureau of Standards
# circular "Standard Time Throughout the World", 1932.
# Assume American Samoa switched to -11 in 1911, not 1950,
# and that after 1950 they agreed until (western) Samoa skipped a
# day in 2011.  Assume also that the Samoas follow the US and New
# Zealand's "ST"/"DT" style of daylight-saving abbreviations.


# Tonga

# From Paul Eggert (2021-03-04):
# In 1943 "The standard time kept is 12 hrs. 19 min. 12 sec. fast
# on Greenwich mean time." according to the Admiralty's Hydrographic
# Dept., Pacific Islands Pilot, Vol. II, 7th ed., 1943, p 360.

# From Michael Deckers (2021-03-03):
# [Ian R Bartky: "One Time Fits All: The Campaigns for Global Uniformity".
# Stanford University Press. 2007. p. 255]:
# On 10 September 1945 Tonga adopted a standard time 12 hours,
# 20 minutes in advance of Greenwich.

# From Paul Eggert (1996-01-22):
# Today's _Wall Street Journal_ (p 1) reports that "Tonga has been plotting
# to sneak ahead of [New Zealanders] by introducing daylight-saving time."
# Since Kiribati has moved the Date Line it's not clear what Tonga will do.

# Don Mundell writes in the 1997-02-20 Tonga Chronicle
# How Tonga became 'The Land where Time Begins':
# http://www.tongatapu.net.to/tonga/homeland/timebegins.htm
#
# Until 1941 Tonga maintained a standard time 50 minutes ahead of NZST
# 12 hours and 20 minutes ahead of GMT.  When New Zealand adjusted its
# standard time in 1940s, Tonga had the choice of subtracting from its
# local time to come on the same standard time as New Zealand or of
# advancing its time to maintain the differential of 13°
# (approximately 50 minutes ahead of New Zealand time).
#
# Because His Majesty King Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV, then Crown Prince
# Tungī, preferred to ensure Tonga's title as the land where time
# begins, the Legislative Assembly approved the latter change.
#
# But some of the older, more conservative members from the outer
# islands objected. "If at midnight on Dec. 31, we move ahead 40
# minutes, as your Royal Highness wishes, what becomes of the 40
# minutes we have lost?"
#
# The Crown Prince, presented an unanswerable argument: "Remember that
# on the World Day of Prayer, you would be the first people on Earth
# to say your prayers in the morning."
#
# From Tim Parenti (2021-09-13), per Paul Eggert (2006-03-22) and Michael
# Deckers (2021-03-03):
# Mundell places the transition from +12:20 to +13 in 1941, while Shanks &
# Pottenger say the transition was on 1968-10-01.
#
# The Air Almanac published contemporaneous tables of standard times,
# which listed +12:20 as of Nov 1960 and +13 as of Mar 1961:

# (Thanks to P Chan for pointing us toward these sources.)
# This agrees with Bartky, who writes that "since 1961 [Tonga's] official time
# has been thirteen hours in advance of Greenwich time" (p. 202) and further
# writes in an endnote that this was because "the legislation was amended" on
# 1960-10-19. (p. 255)
#
# Without greater specificity, presume that Bartky and the Air Almanac point to
# a 1961-01-01 transition, as Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV was still Crown Prince in
# 1961 and this still jives with the gist of Mundell's telling, and go with
# this over Shanks & Pottenger.

# From Eric Ulevik (1999-05-03):
# Tonga's director of tourism, who is also secretary of the National Millennium
# Committee, has a plan to get Tonga back in front.
# He has proposed a one-off move to tropical daylight saving for Tonga from
# October to March, which has won approval in principle from the Tongan
# Government.

# From Steffen Thorsen (1999-09-09):
# * Tonga will introduce DST in November
#
# I was given this link by John Letts:
# http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/asia-pacific/newsid_424000/424764.stm
#
# I have not been able to find exact dates for the transition in November
# yet. By reading this article it seems like Fiji will be 14 hours ahead
# of UTC as well, but as far as I know Fiji will only be 13 hours ahead
# (12 + 1 hour DST).

# From Arthur David Olson (1999-09-20):
# According to <http://www.tongaonline.com/news/sept1799.html>:
# "Daylight Savings Time will take effect on Oct. 2 through April 15, 2000
# and annually thereafter from the first Saturday in October through the
# third Saturday of April.  Under the system approved by Privy Council on
# Sept. 10, clocks must be turned ahead one hour on the opening day and
# set back an hour on the closing date."
# Alas, no indication of the time of day.

# From Rives McDow (1999-10-06):
# Tonga started its Daylight Saving on Saturday morning October 2nd at 0200am.
# Daylight Saving ends on April 16 at 0300am which is Sunday morning.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2000-10-31):
# Back in March I found a notice on the website http://www.tongaonline.com
# that Tonga changed back to standard time one month early, on March 19
# instead of the original reported date April 16. Unfortunately, the article
# is no longer available on the site, and I did not make a copy of the
# text, and I have forgotten to report it here.
# (Original URL was <http://www.tongaonline.com/news/march162000.htm>)

# From Rives McDow (2000-12-01):
# Tonga is observing DST as of 2000-11-04 and will stop on 2001-01-27.

# From Sione Moala-Mafi (2001-09-20) via Rives McDow:
# At 2:00am on the first Sunday of November, the standard time in the Kingdom
# shall be moved forward by one hour to 3:00am.  At 2:00am on the last Sunday
# of January the standard time in the Kingdom shall be moved backward by one
# hour to 1:00am.

# From Pulu ʻAnau (2002-11-05):
# The law was for 3 years, supposedly to get renewed.  It wasn't.

# From Pulu ʻAnau (2016-10-27):
# http://mic.gov.to/news-today/press-releases/6375-daylight-saving-set-to-run-from-6-november-2016-to-15-january-2017
# Cannot find anyone who knows the rules, has seen the duration or has seen
# the cabinet decision, but it appears we are following Fiji's rule set.
#
# From Tim Parenti (2016-10-26):
# Assume Tonga will observe DST from the first Sunday in November at 02:00
# through the third Sunday in January at 03:00, like Fiji, for now.

# From David Wade (2017-10-18):
# In August government was dissolved by the King.  The current prime minister
# continued in office in care taker mode.  It is easy to see that few
# decisions will be made until elections 16th November.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-10-18):
# For now, guess that DST is discontinued.  That's what the IATA is guessing.


###############################################################################

# The International Date Line

# From Gwillim Law (2000-01-03):
#
# The International Date Line is not defined by any international standard,
# convention, or treaty.  Mapmakers are free to draw it as they please.
# Reputable mapmakers will simply ensure that every point of land appears on
# the correct side of the IDL, according to the date legally observed there.
#
# When Kiribati adopted a uniform date in 1995, thereby moving the Phoenix and
# Line Islands to the west side of the IDL (or, if you prefer, moving the IDL
# to the east side of the Phoenix and Line Islands), I suppose that most
# mapmakers redrew the IDL following the boundary of Kiribati.  Even that line
# has a rather arbitrary nature.  The straight-line boundaries between Pacific
# island nations that are shown on many maps are based on an international
# convention, but are not legally binding national borders.... The date is
# governed by the IDL; therefore, even on the high seas, there may be some
# places as late as fourteen hours later than UTC.  And, since the IDL is not
# an international standard, there are some places on the high seas where the
# correct date is ambiguous.

# From Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_time> (2023-01-23):
# The nautical time zone system is analogous to the terrestrial time zone
# system for use on high seas.  Under the system time changes are required for
# changes of longitude in one-hour steps.  The one-hour step corresponds to a
# time zone width of 15° longitude.  The 15° gore that is offset from GMT or
# UT1 (not UTC) by twelve hours is bisected by the nautical date line into two
# 7°30' gores that differ from GMT by ±12 hours.  A nautical date line is
# implied but not explicitly drawn on time zone maps.  It follows the 180th
# meridian except where it is interrupted by territorial waters adjacent to
# land, forming gaps: it is a pole-to-pole dashed line.

# From Paul Eggert (2023-01-23):
# The American Practical Navigator <https://msi.nga.mil/Publications/APN>,
# 2019 edition, merely says that the International Date Line
# "coincides with the 180th meridian over most of its length."
# tzdb links for backward compatibility

# This file is in the public domain, so clarified as of
# 2009-05-17 by Arthur David Olson.

# This file provides links from old or merged timezone names to current ones.
# Many names changed in 1993 and in 1995, and many merged names moved here
# in the period from 2013 through 2022.  Several of these names are
# also present in the file 'backzone', which has data important only
# for pre-1970 timestamps and so is out of scope for tzdb proper.

# Although this file is optional and tzdb will work if you omit it by
# building with 'make BACKWARD=', in practice downstream users
# typically use this file for backward compatibility.

# This file is divided into sections, one for each major reason for a
# backward compatibility link.  Each section is sorted by link name.

# A "#= TARGET1" comment labels each link inserted only because some
# .zi parsers (including tzcode through 2022e) mishandle links to links.
# The comment says what the target would be if these parsers were fixed
# so that data could contain links to links.  For example, the line
# "Link Australia/Sydney Australia/ACT #= Australia/Canberra" would be
# "Link Australia/Canberra Australia/ACT" were it not that data lines
# refrain from linking to links like Australia/Canberra, which means
# the Australia/ACT line links instead to Australia/Sydney,
# Australia/Canberra's target.

# This file is by no means authoritative; if you think you know
# better, go ahead and edit it (and please send any changes to

# From Paul Eggert (2014-10-31):

# This file contains data outside the normal scope of the tz database,
# in that its zones do not differ from normal tz zones after 1970.
# Links in this file point to zones in this file, superseding links in
# the file 'backward'.

# Although zones in this file may be of some use for analyzing
# pre-1970 timestamps, they are less reliable, cover only a tiny
# sliver of the pre-1970 era, and cannot feasibly be improved to cover
# most of the era.  Because the zones are out of normal scope for the
# database, less effort is put into maintaining this file.  Many of
# the zones were formerly in other source files, but were removed or
# replaced by links as their data entries were questionable and/or they
# differed from other zones only in pre-1970 timestamps.

# Unless otherwise specified, the source for data through 1990 is:
# Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
# Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.

# This file is not intended to be compiled standalone, as it
# assumes rules from other files.  In the tz distribution, use
# 'make PACKRATDATA=backzone zones' to compile and install this file.


# From Paul Eggert (2020-04-15):
# The following remarks should be incorporated into this table sometime.
# Patches in 'git format-patch' format would be welcome.
#
# From Phake Nick (2020-04-15):
# ... the historical timezone data for those China zones seems to be
# incorrect.  The transition to GMT+8 date given there for these zones
# were 1980 which also contradict the file description that they do
# not disagree with normal zone after 1970.  According to sources that
# have also been cited in the asia file, except Xinjiang and Tibet,
# they should have adopted the Beijing Time from around 1949/1950
# depends on exactly when each of those cities were taken over by the
# communist army.  And they should also follow the DST setting of
# Asia/Shanghai after that point of time.  In addition,
# http://gaz.ncl.edu.tw/detail.jsp?sysid=E1091792 the document from
# Chongqing Nationalist government say in year 1945 all of China
# should adopt summer time due to the war (not sure whether it
# continued after WWII ends)(Probably only enforced in area under
# their rule at the time?)  The Asia/Harbin's 1932 and 1940 entry
# should also be incorrect.  As per sources recorded at
# https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/%E6%BA%80%E5%B7%9E%E5%9B%BD%E3%81%AE%E6%A8%99%E6%BA%96%E6%99%82
# , in 1932 Harbin should have adopted UTC+8:00 instead of data
# currently listed in the tz database according to official
# announcement from Manchuko.  And they should have adopted GMT+9 in
# 1937 January 1st according to official announcement at the time
# being cited on the webpage.

# Ethiopia
# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-31):
# Like the Swahili of Kenya and Tanzania, many Ethiopians keep a
# 12-hour clock starting at our 06:00, so their "8 o'clock" is our
# 02:00 or 14:00.  Keep this in mind when you ask the time in Amharic.
#
# Shanks & Pottenger write that Ethiopia had six narrowly spaced time
# zones between 1870 and 1890, that they merged to 38E50 (2:35:20) in
# 1890, and that they switched to 3:00 on 1936-05-05.  Perhaps 38E50
# was for Adis Dera.  Quite likely the Shanks data entries are wrong
# anyway.

# Atikokan, Ontario

# From Paul Eggert (1997-10-17):
# Mark Brader writes that an article in the 1997-10-14 Toronto Star
# says that Atikokan, Ontario currently does not observe DST,
# but will vote on 11-10 whether to use EST/EDT.
# He also writes that the Ontario Time Act (1990, Chapter T.9)
# http://www.gov.on.ca/MBS/english/publications/statregs/conttext.html
# says that Ontario east of 90W uses EST/EDT, and west of 90W uses CST/CDT.
# Officially Atikokan is therefore on CST/CDT, and most likely this report
# concerns a non-official time observed as a matter of local practice.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Atikokan, Pickle Lake, and
# New Osnaburgh observe CST all year, that Big Trout Lake observes
# CST/CDT, and that Upsala and Shebandowan observe EST/EDT, all in
# violation of the official Ontario rules.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-09):
# Chris Walton (2006-07-06) mentioned an article by Stephanie MacLellan in the
# 2005-07-21 Chronicle-Journal, which said:
#
#	The clocks in Atikokan stay set on standard time year-round.
#	This means they spend about half the time on central time and
#	the other half on eastern time.
#
#	For the most part, the system works, Mayor Dennis Brown said.
#
#	"The majority of businesses in Atikokan deal more with Eastern
#	Canada, but there are some that deal with Western Canada," he
#	said.  "I don't see any changes happening here."
#
# Walton also writes "Supposedly Pickle Lake and Mishkeegogamang
# [New Osnaburgh] follow the same practice."

# From Garry McKinnon (2006-07-14) via Chris Walton:
# I chatted with a member of my board who has an outstanding memory
# and a long history in Atikokan (and in the telecom industry) and he
# can say for certain that Atikokan has been practicing the current
# time keeping since 1952, at least.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-17):
# Shanks & Pottenger say that Atikokan has agreed with Rainy River
# ever since standard time was introduced, but the information from
# McKinnon sounds more authoritative.  For now, assume that Atikokan
# switched to EST immediately after WWII era daylight saving time
# ended.  This matches the old (less populous) America/Coral_Harbour
# entry since our cutoff date of 1970, so we can move
# America/Coral_Harbour to the 'backward' file.

# Quebec east of Natashquan

# From Paul Eggert (2021-05-09):
# H. David Matthews and Mary Vincent's map
# "It's about TIME", _Canadian Geographic_ (September-October 1998)
# http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/SO98/alacarte.asp
# says that Quebec east of the -63 meridian is supposed to observe
# AST, but residents as far east as Natashquan use EST/EDT, and
# residents east of Natashquan use AST.
# The Quebec department of justice writes in
# "The situation in Minganie and Basse-Côte-Nord"
# https://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/en/department/ministre/functions-and-responsabilities/legal-time-in-quebec/the-situation-in-minganie-and-basse-cote-nord/
# that the coastal strip from just east of Natashquan to Blanc-Sablon

# This common practice was codified into law as of 2007; see Legal Time Act,
# CQLR c T-5.1 <http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/T-5.1>.
# For lack of better info, guess this practice began around 1970, contra to

# From Chris Walton (2011-12-01):
# There are two areas within the Canadian province of British Columbia
# that do not currently observe daylight saving:
# a) The Creston Valley (includes the town of Creston and surrounding area)
# b) The eastern half of the Peace River Regional District
# (includes the cities of Dawson Creek and Fort St. John)

# Earlier this year I stumbled across a detailed article about the time
# keeping history of Creston; it was written by Tammy Hardwick who is the
# manager of the Creston & District Museum. The article was written in May 2009.
# http://www.ilovecreston.com/?p=articles&t=spec&ar=260
# According to the article, Creston has not changed its clocks since June 1918.
# i.e. Creston has been stuck on UT-7 for 93 years.
# Dawson Creek, on the other hand, changed its clocks as recently as April 1972.

# Unfortunately the exact date for the time change in June 1918 remains
# unknown and will be difficult to ascertain.  I e-mailed Tammy a few months
# ago to ask if Sunday June 2 was a reasonable guess.  She said it was just
# as plausible as any other date (in June).  She also said that after writing
# the article she had discovered another time change in 1916; this is the
# subject of another article which she wrote in October 2010.
# http://www.creston.museum.bc.ca/index.php?module=comments&uop=view_comment&cm+id=56

# Here is a summary of the three clock change events in Creston's history:
# 1. 1884 or 1885: adoption of Mountain Standard Time (GMT-7)
# Exact date unknown
# 2. Oct 1916: switch to Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8)
# Exact date in October unknown; Sunday October 1 is a reasonable guess.
# 3. June 1918: switch to Pacific Daylight Time (GMT-7)
# Exact date in June unknown; Sunday June 2 is a reasonable guess.
# note 1:
# On Oct 27/1918 when daylight saving ended in the rest of Canada,
# Creston did not change its clocks.
# note 2:
# During WWII when the Federal Government legislated a mandatory clock change,
# Creston did not oblige.
# note 3:
# There is no guarantee that Creston will remain on Mountain Standard Time
# (UTC-7) forever.
# The subject was debated at least once this year by the town Council.
# http://www.bclocalnews.com/kootenay_rockies/crestonvalleyadvance/news/116760809.html

# During a period WWII, summer time (Daylight saying) was mandatory in Canada.
# In Creston, that was handled by shifting the area to PST (-8:00) then applying
# summer time to cause the offset to be -7:00, the same as it had been before
# the change.  It can be argued that the timezone abbreviation during this
# period should be PDT rather than MST, but that doesn't seem important enough
# (to anyone) to further complicate the rules.

# The transition dates (and times) are guesses.

# Milne gives 4:35:46.9 for Curaçao mean time; round to nearest.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Shanks & Pottenger say that The Bottom and Philipsburg have been at
# -4:00 since standard time was introduced on 1912-03-02; and that
# Kralendijk and Rincon used Kralendijk Mean Time (-4:33:08) from
# 1912-02-02 to 1965-01-01.  The former is dubious, since S&P also say
# Saba Island has been like Curaçao.
# This all predates our 1970 cutoff, though.
#
# By July 2007 Curaçao and St Maarten are planned to become
# associated states within the Netherlands, much like Aruba;
# Bonaire, Saba and St Eustatius would become directly part of the
# Netherlands as Kingdom Islands.  This won't affect their time zones
# though, as far as we know.

# From Rives McDow (1999-11-08):
# On October 31, when the rest of Nunavut went to Central time,
# Pangnirtung wobbled.  Here is the result of their wobble:
#
# The following businesses and organizations in Pangnirtung use Central Time:
#
#	First Air, Power Corp, Nunavut Construction, Health Center, RCMP,
#	Eastern Arctic National Parks, A & D Specialist
#
# The following businesses and organizations in Pangnirtung use Eastern Time:
#
#	Hamlet office, All other businesses, Both schools, Airport operator
#
# This has made for an interesting situation there, which warranted the news.
# No one there that I spoke with seems concerned, or has plans to
# change the local methods of keeping time, as it evidently does not
# really interfere with any activities or make things difficult locally.
# They plan to celebrate New Year's turn-over twice, one hour apart,
# so it appears that the situation will last at least that long.
# The Nunavut Intergovernmental Affairs hopes that they will "come to
# their senses", but the locals evidently don't see any problem with
# the current state of affairs.

# From Michaela Rodrigue, writing in the
# Nunatsiaq News (1999-11-19):
# http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/archives/nunavut991130/nvt91119_17.html
# Clyde River, Pangnirtung and Sanikiluaq now operate with two time zones,
# central - or Nunavut time - for government offices, and eastern time
# for municipal offices and schools....  Igloolik [was similar but then]
# made the switch to central time on Saturday, Nov. 6.

# From Chris Walton (2022-11-06):
# The implication is that Pangnirtung and Qikiqtarjuaq have observed Eastern
# Time as far back as 1984 (and likely even further back than that).
# It is possible that these communities never actually observed Atlantic
# Time, but that would be difficult to prove.
# From Paul Eggert (2022-11-06):
# This is in 'backzone' as we have no good evidence that Pangnirtung differs
# from America/Iqaluit since 1970.  A Google Books snippet view of
# volume 2, page 186 of "Pilot of Arctic Canada", published 1959 by

#
# From David Bryan via Tory Tronrud, Director/Curator,
# Thunder Bay Museum (2003-11-12):
# There is some suggestion, however, that, by-law or not, daylight
# savings time was being practiced in Fort William and Port Arthur
# before 1909.... [I]n 1910, the line between the Eastern and Central
# Time Zones was permanently moved about two hundred miles west to
# include the Thunder Bay area....  When Canada adopted daylight
# savings time in 1916, Fort William and Port Arthur, having done so
# already, did not change their clocks....  During the Second World
# War,... [t]he cities agreed to implement DST during the summer
# months for the remainder of the war years.
#
# From Jeffery Nichols (2020-02-06):
# According to the [Shanks] atlas, those western Ontario zones are huge,

# Vostok, which is one of the Russian stations, is set on the same

#
# From Lee Hotz (2001-03-08):
# I queried the folks at Columbia who spent the summer at Vostok and this is
# what they had to say about time there:
# "in the US Camp (East Camp) we have been on New Zealand (McMurdo)
# time, which is 12 hours ahead of GMT. The Russian Station Vostok was
# 6 hours behind that (although only 2 miles away, i.e. 6 hours ahead
# of GMT). This is a time zone I think two hours east of Moscow. The
# natural time zone is in between the two: 8 hours ahead of GMT."
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-05-04):
# This seems to be hopelessly confusing, so I asked Lee Hotz about it
# in person.  He said that some Antarctic locations set their local
# time so that noon is the warmest part of the day, and that this
# changes during the year and does not necessarily correspond to mean
# solar noon.  So the Vostok time might have been whatever the clocks
# happened to be during their visit.  So we still don't really know what time
# it is at Vostok.  But we'll guess +06.

# https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/why-gulf-standard-time-is-far-from-standard-the-fascinating-story-behind-the-time-zone-s-invention-1.1052589
# Stewart writes that before 1941 some companies in Bahrain were at +0330 and
# others at +0323.  Reginald George Alban, a British political agent based in
# Manama, worked to standardize this, and from 1941-07-20 Bahrain was at
# +0330.  However, BOAC asked that clocks be moved to gain more light at day's
# end, so Bahrain switched to +04 on 1944-01-01.
#
# Re the 1941 transition, Stewart privately sent me this citation:
# "File 16/53 Enquiries Re: Calculation of Local Time", British Library: India

# https://www.qdl.qa/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00012b
# It says there was no real standard in Bahrain before 1941-07-20.
# +0330 was used by steamers of the British India Co, by Petroleum Concessions
# and by Cable & Wireless; +0323 was used by the Eastern Bank Ltd, BOAC, and
# Bahrein Petroleum (Bapco), and California Arabian Standard Oil Co (Casoc)
# adopted DST effective 1941-05-24.  Alban suggested adopting DST, R.B. Coomb
# of C&W countersuggested +0330, and although C.A. Rodstrom of Casoc (formerly
# of Bapco) stated that Bahrain had formerly used +0330 before Bapco arrived
# but Bapco switched to +0323 because of "constant confusion", the consensus
# was +0330.  The government adopted +0330 in 1941-07-20 and companies seem to
# have switched by 08-01.  No time of day was given for the 1940s transitions.

# Cambodia

# From an adoptive daughter of the late Cambodian ruler Prince Sihanouk,
# via Alois Treindl (2019-08-08):
#
# King Sihanouk said that, during the Japanese occupation, starting with
# what historians refer to as "le coup de force du 9 mars 1945", Cambodia,
# like the entire French Indochina, used Tokyo time zone. After Japan
# surrendered, 2 September 1945, Cambodia fell under French rule again and
# adopted Hanoi time zone again.
#
# However, on 7 January 1946, Sihanouk and Tioulong managed to obtain a
# status of "internal autonomy" from the government of Charles de Gaulle.
# Although many fields remained under the administration of the French
# (customs, taxes, justice, defence, foreign affairs, etc.), the Cambodian
# administration was responsible for religious matters and traditional
# celebrations, which included our calendar and time.  The time zone was GMT
# + 7 and _no_ DST was applied.
#
# After Sihanouk and Tioulong achieved full independence, on 9 November 1953,
# GMT + 7 was maintained.

# Iceland
#
# From Adam David (1993-11-06):
# The name of the timezone in Iceland for system / mail / news purposes is GMT.
#
# (1993-12-05):
# This material is paraphrased from the 1988 edition of the University of
# Iceland Almanak.
#
# From January 1st, 1908 the whole of Iceland was standardised at 1 hour
# behind GMT. Previously, local mean solar time was used in different parts
# of Iceland, the almanak had been based on Reykjavík mean solar time which
# was 1 hour and 28 minutes behind GMT.
#
# "first day of winter" referred to [below] means the first day of the 26 weeks
# of winter, according to the old icelandic calendar that dates back to the
# time the norsemen first settled Iceland.  The first day of winter is always
# Saturday, but is not dependent on the Julian or Gregorian calendars.
#
# (1993-12-10):
# I have a reference from the Oxford Icelandic-English dictionary for the
# beginning of winter, which ties it to the ecclesiastical calendar (and thus
# to the julian/gregorian calendar) over the period in question.
#	the winter begins on the Saturday next before St. Luke's day
#	(old style), or on St. Luke's day, if a Saturday.
# St. Luke's day ought to be traceable from ecclesiastical sources. "old style"
# might be a reference to the Julian calendar as opposed to Gregorian, or it
# might mean something else (???).

# Netherlands

# Howse writes that the Netherlands' railways used GMT between 1892 and 1940,
# but for other purposes the Netherlands used Amsterdam mean time.

# However, Robert H. van Gent writes (2001-04-01):
# Howse's statement is only correct up to 1909. From 1909-05-01 (00:00:00
# Amsterdam mean time) onwards, the whole of the Netherlands (including
# the Dutch railways) was required by law to observe Amsterdam mean time
# (19 minutes 32.13 seconds ahead of GMT). This had already been the
# common practice (except for the railways) for many decades but it was
# not until 1909 when the Dutch government finally defined this by law.
# On 1937-07-01 this was changed to 20 minutes (exactly) ahead of GMT and
# was generally known as Dutch Time ("Nederlandse Tijd").
#
# (2001-04-08):
# 1892-05-01 was the date when the Dutch railways were by law required to
# observe GMT while the remainder of the Netherlands adhered to the common
# practice of following Amsterdam mean time.
#
# (2001-04-09):
# In 1835 the authorities of the province of North Holland requested the
# municipal authorities of the towns and cities in the province to observe
# Amsterdam mean time but I do not know in how many cases this request was
# actually followed.
#
# From 1852 onwards the Dutch telegraph offices were by law required to
# observe Amsterdam mean time. As the time signals from the observatory of
# Leiden were also distributed by the telegraph system, I assume that most
# places linked up with the telegraph (and railway) system automatically
# adopted Amsterdam mean time.
#
# Although the early Dutch railway companies initially observed a variety
# of times, most of them had adopted Amsterdam mean time by 1858 but it
# was not until 1866 when they were all required by law to observe
# Amsterdam mean time.

# The data entries before 1945 are taken from
# https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/wettijd/wettijd.htm

# From Paul Eggert (2021-05-09):

# Netherlands Summer Time, used in the Netherlands from 1835 to 1937.

# Denmark

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2005-04-26):
# the law [introducing standard time] was in effect from 1894-01-01....
# The page https://www.retsinformation.dk/eli/lta/1893/83
# confirms this, and states that the law was put forth 1893-03-29.
#
# The EU [actually, EEC and Euratom] treaty with effect from 1973:
# https://www.retsinformation.dk/eli/lta/1972/21100
#
# This provoked a new law from 1974 to make possible summer time changes
# in subsequent decrees with the law
# https://www.retsinformation.dk/eli/lta/1974/223
#
# It seems however that no decree was set forward until 1980.  I have
# not found any decree, but in another related law, the effecting DST
# changes are stated explicitly to be from 1980-04-06 at 02:00 to
# 1980-09-28 at 02:00.  If this is true, this differs slightly from
# the EU rule in that DST runs to 02:00, not 03:00.  We don't know
# when Denmark began using the EU rule correctly, but we have only
# confirmation of the 1980-time, so I presume it was correct in 1981:
# The law is about the management of the extra hour, concerning
# working hours reported and effect on obligatory-rest rules (which
# was suspended on that night):
# https://web.archive.org/web/20140104053304/https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=60267

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2005-06-11):
# The Herning Folkeblad (1980-09-26) reported that the night between
# Saturday and Sunday the clock is set back from three to two.

# From Paul Eggert (2005-06-11):
# Hence the "02:00" of the 1980 law refers to standard time, not
# wall-clock time, and so the EU rules were in effect in 1980.

# Time Act in 1883 and including additional confirmation of some of
# the dates of the 'Summer Time' orders originating at
# Westminster.  There is a little uncertainty as to the starting date
# of the first summer time in 1916 which may have been announced a
# couple of days late.  There is still a substantial number of

# Sweden

# From Ivan Nilsson (2001-04-13), superseding Shanks & Pottenger:
#
# The law "Svensk författningssamling 1878, no 14" about standard time in 1879:
# From the beginning of 1879 (that is 01-01 00:00) the time for all
# places in the country is "the mean solar time for the meridian at
# three degrees, or twelve minutes of time, to the west of the
# meridian of the Observatory of Stockholm".  The law is dated 1878-05-31.
#
# The observatory at that time had the meridian 18° 03' 30"
# eastern longitude = 01:12:14 in time.  Less 12 minutes gives the
# national standard time as 01:00:14 ahead of GMT....
#
# About the beginning of CET in Sweden. The lawtext ("Svensk
# författningssamling 1899, no 44") states, that "from the beginning
# of 1900... ... the same as the mean solar time for the meridian at
# the distance of one hour of time from the meridian of the English
# observatory at Greenwich, or at 12 minutes 14 seconds to the west
# from the meridian of the Observatory of Stockholm". The law is dated
# 1899-06-16.  In short: At 1900-01-01 00:00:00 the new standard time
# in Sweden is 01:00:00 ahead of GMT.
#
# 1916: The lawtext ("Svensk författningssamling 1916, no 124") states
# that "1916-05-15 is considered to begin one hour earlier". It is
# pretty obvious that at 05-14 23:00 the clocks are set to 05-15 00:00....
# Further the law says, that "1916-09-30 is considered to end one hour later".
#
# The laws regulating [DST] are available on the site of the Swedish
# Parliament beginning with 1985 - the laws regulating 1980/1984 are
# not available on the site (to my knowledge they are only available
# in Swedish): <http://www.riksdagen.se/english/work/sfst.asp> (type

#
# (2001-05-13):
#
# I have now found a newspaper stating that at 1916-10-01 01:00
# summertime the church-clocks etc were set back one hour to show
# 1916-10-01 00:00 standard time.  The article also reports that some

information and sources go beyond Theory.html's brief discussion.
They sometimes disagree.


France

Gregorian calendar adopted 1582-12-20.
French Revolutionary calendar used 1793-11-24 through 1805-12-31,
and (in Paris only) 1871-05-06 through 1871-05-23.


Russia

From Chris Carrier (1996-12-02):
On 1929-10-01 the Soviet Union instituted an "Eternal Calendar"
with 30-day months plus 5 holidays, with a 5-day week.
On 1931-12-01 it changed to a 6-day week; in 1934 it reverted to the
Gregorian calendar while retaining the 6-day week; on 1940-06-27 it
reverted to the 7-day week.  With the 6-day week the usual days
off were the 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th and 30th of the month.
(Source: Evitiar Zerubavel, _The Seven Day Circle_)


Mark Brader reported a similar story in "The Book of Calendars", edited
by Frank Parise (1982, Facts on File, ISBN 0-8719-6467-8), page 377.  But:

If your source is correct, how come documents between 1929 and 1940 were
still dated using the conventional, Gregorian calendar?

I can post a scan of a document dated December 1, 1934, signed by
Yenukidze, the secretary, on behalf of Kalinin, the President of the
Executive Committee of the Supreme Soviet, if you like.



Sweden (and Finland)

From: Mark Brader
Subject: Re: Gregorian reform - a part of locale?
<news:1996Jul6.012937.29190@sq.com>
Date: 1996-07-06

In 1700, Denmark made the transition from Julian to Gregorian.  Sweden
decided to *start* a transition in 1700 as well, but rather than have one of
those unsightly calendar gaps :-), they simply decreed that the next leap
year after 1696 would be in 1744 - putting the whole country on a calendar
different from both Julian and Gregorian for a period of 40 years.

However, in 1704 something went wrong and the plan was not carried through;
they did, after all, have a leap year that year.  And one in 1708.  In 1712
they gave it up and went back to Julian, putting 30 days in February that
year!...

Then in 1753, Sweden made the transition to Gregorian in the usual manner,
getting there only 13 years behind the original schedule.

(A previous posting of this story was challenged, and Swedish readers
produced the following references to support it: "Tideräkning och historia"
by Natanael Beckman (1924) and "Tid, en bok om tideräkning och
kalenderväsen" by Lars-Olof Lodén (1968).

# tzdb data for ships at sea and other miscellany

# This file is in the public domain, so clarified as of
# 2009-05-17 by Arthur David Olson.

# These entries are for uses not otherwise covered by the tz database.
# Their main practical use is for platforms like Android that lack
# support for POSIX-style TZ strings.  On such platforms these entries
# can be useful if the timezone database is wrong or if a ship or
# aircraft at sea is not in a timezone.

# Starting with POSIX 1003.1-2001, the entries below are all
# unnecessary as settings for the TZ environment variable.  E.g.,
# instead of TZ='Etc/GMT+4' one can use the POSIX setting TZ='<-04>+4'.
#
# Do not use a POSIX TZ setting like TZ='GMT+4', which is four hours
# behind GMT but uses the completely misleading abbreviation "GMT".

# The following zone is used by tzcode functions like gmtime,
# which load the "UTC" file to handle seconds properly.
Zone	Etc/UTC		0	-	UTC

# Functions like gmtime load the "GMT" file to handle leap seconds properly.
# Vanguard section, which works with most .zi parsers.
#Zone	GMT		0	-	GMT
# Rearguard section, for TZUpdater 2.3.2 and earlier.
Zone	Etc/GMT		0	-	GMT

# The following link uses older naming conventions,
# but it belongs here, not in the file 'backward',
# as it is needed for tzcode releases through 2022a,
# where functions like gmtime load "GMT" instead of the "Etc/UTC".
# We want this to work even on installations that omit 'backward'.
Link	Etc/GMT				GMT
# End of rearguard section.

# Be consistent with POSIX TZ settings in the Zone names,
# even though this is the opposite of what many people expect.
# POSIX has positive signs west of Greenwich, but many people expect
# positive signs east of Greenwich.  For example, TZ='Etc/GMT+4' uses
# the abbreviation "-04" and corresponds to 4 hours behind UT
# (i.e. west of Greenwich) even though many people would expect it to
# mean 4 hours ahead of UT (i.e. east of Greenwich).

# Earlier incarnations of this package were not POSIX-compliant,
# and had lines such as
#		Zone	GMT-12		-12	-	GMT-1200
# We did not want things to change quietly if someone accustomed to the old
# way does a
#		zic -l GMT-12
# so we moved the names into the Etc subdirectory.
# Also, the time zone abbreviations are now compatible with %z.

# Britain (United Kingdom) and Ireland (Eire)

# From Peter Ilieve (1994-07-06):
#
# On 17 Jan 1994 the Independent, a UK quality newspaper, had a piece about
# historical vistas along the Thames in west London. There was a photo
# and a sketch map showing some of the sightlines involved. One paragraph
# of the text said:
#
# 'An old stone obelisk marking a forgotten terrestrial meridian stands
# beside the river at Kew. In the 18th century, before time and longitude
# was standardised by the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, scholars observed
# this stone and the movement of stars from Kew Observatory nearby. They
# made their calculations and set the time for the Horse Guards and Parliament,
# but now the stone is obscured by scrubwood and can only be seen by walking
# along the towpath within a few yards of it.'
#
# I have a one inch to one mile map of London and my estimate of the stone's
# position is 51° 28' 30" N, 0° 18' 45" W. The longitude should
# be within about ±2". The Ordnance Survey grid reference is TQ172761.
#
# [This yields STDOFF = -0:01:15 for London LMT in the 18th century.]

# From Paul Eggert (1993-11-18):
#
# Howse writes that Britain was the first country to use standard time.
# The railways cared most about the inconsistencies of local mean time,
# and it was they who forced a uniform time on the country.
# The original idea was credited to Dr. William Hyde Wollaston (1766-1828)
# and was popularized by Abraham Follett Osler (1808-1903).
# The first railway to adopt London time was the Great Western Railway
# in November 1840; other railways followed suit, and by 1847 most
# (though not all) railways used London time.  On 1847-09-22 the
# Railway Clearing House, an industry standards body, recommended that GMT be
# adopted at all stations as soon as the General Post Office permitted it.
# The transition occurred on 12-01 for the L&NW, the Caledonian,
# and presumably other railways; the January 1848 Bradshaw's lists many
# railways as using GMT.  By 1855 the vast majority of public
# clocks in Britain were set to GMT (though some, like the great clock
# on Tom Tower at Christ Church, Oxford, were fitted with two minute hands,
# one for local time and one for GMT).  The last major holdout was the legal
# system, which stubbornly stuck to local time for many years, leading
# to oddities like polls opening at 08:13 and closing at 16:13.
# The legal system finally switched to GMT when the Statutes (Definition
# of Time) Act took effect; it received the Royal Assent on 1880-08-02.
#
# In the tables below, we condense this complicated story into a single
# transition date for London, namely 1847-12-01.  We don't know as much
# about Dublin, so we use 1880-08-02, the legal transition time.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-19):
# The ancients had no need for daylight saving, as they kept time
# informally or via hours whose length depended on the time of year.
# Daylight saving time in its modern sense was invented by the
# New Zealand entomologist George Vernon Hudson (1867-1946),
# whose day job as a postal clerk led him to value
# after-hours daylight in which to pursue his research.
# In 1895 he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society
# that proposed a two-hour daylight-saving shift.  See:
# Hudson GV. On seasonal time-adjustment in countries south of lat. 30°.
# Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute. 1895;28:734
# http://rsnz.natlib.govt.nz/volume/rsnz_28/rsnz_28_00_006110.html
# Although some interest was expressed in New Zealand, his proposal
# did not find its way into law and eventually it was almost forgotten.
#
# In England, DST was independently reinvented by William Willett (1857-1915),
# a London builder and member of the Royal Astronomical Society
# who circulated a pamphlet "The Waste of Daylight" (1907)
# that proposed advancing clocks 20 minutes on each of four Sundays in April,
# and retarding them by the same amount on four Sundays in September.
# A bill was drafted in 1909 and introduced in Parliament several times,
# but it met with ridicule and opposition, especially from farming interests.
# Later editions of the pamphlet proposed one-hour summer time, and
# it was eventually adopted as a wartime measure in 1916.
# See: Summer Time Arrives Early, The Times (2000-05-18).
# A monument to Willett was unveiled on 1927-05-21, in an open space in
# a 45-acre wood near Chislehurst, Kent that was purchased by popular
# subscription and open to the public.  On the south face of the monolith,
# designed by G. W. Miller, is the William Willett Memorial Sundial,
# which is permanently set to Summer Time.

# From Winston Churchill (1934-04-28):
# It is one of the paradoxes of history that we should owe the boon of
# summer time, which gives every year to the people of this country
# between 160 and 170 hours more daylight leisure, to a war which
# plunged Europe into darkness for four years, and shook the
# foundations of civilization throughout the world.

# From Paul Eggert (2015-08-08):
# The OED Supplement says that the English originally said "Daylight Saving"
# when they were debating the adoption of DST in 1908; but by 1916 this
# term appears only in quotes taken from DST's opponents, whereas the
# proponents (who eventually won the argument) are quoted as using "Summer".
# The term "Summer Time" was introduced by Herbert Samuel, Home Secretary; see:
# Viscount Samuel. Leisure in a Democracy. Cambridge University Press
# ISBN 978-1-107-49471-8 (1949, reissued 2015), p 8.

# From Arthur David Olson (1989-01-19):
# A source at the British Information Office in New York avers that it's
# known as "British" Summer Time in all parts of the United Kingdom.

# Date: 4 Jan 89 08:57:25 GMT (Wed)
# From: Jonathan Leffler
# [British Summer Time] is fixed annually by Act of Parliament.
# If you can predict what Parliament will do, you should be in
# politics making a fortune, not computing.

# From Chris Carrier (1996-06-14):
# I remember reading in various wartime issues of the London Times the
# acronym BDST for British Double Summer Time.  Look for the published
# time of sunrise and sunset in The Times, when BDST was in effect, and
# if you find a zone reference it will say, "All times B.D.S.T."

# From Joseph S. Myers (1999-09-02):
# ... some military cables (WO 219/4100 - this is a copy from the
# main SHAEF archives held in the US National Archives, SHAEF/5252/8/516)
# agree that the usage is BDST (this appears in a message dated 17 Feb 1945).

# From Joseph S. Myers (2000-10-03):
# On 18th April 1941, Sir Stephen Tallents of the BBC wrote to Sir
# Alexander Maxwell of the Home Office asking whether there was any
# official designation; the reply of the 21st was that there wasn't
# but he couldn't think of anything better than the "Double British
# Summer Time" that the BBC had been using informally.
# https://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/bbc-19410418.png
# https://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/ho-19410421.png

# From Sir Alexander Maxwell in the above-mentioned letter (1941-04-21):
# [N]o official designation has as far as I know been adopted for the time
# which is to be introduced in May....
# I cannot think of anything better than "Double British Summer Time"
# which could not be said to run counter to any official description.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):
# Howse writes (p 157) 'DBST' too, but 'BDST' seems to have been common
# and follows the more usual convention of putting the location name first,
# so we use 'BDST'.

# Peter Ilieve (1998-04-19) described at length
# the history of summer time legislation in the United Kingdom.
# Since 1998 Joseph S. Myers has been updating
# and extending this list, which can be found in
# https://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/

# From Joseph S. Myers (1998-01-06):
#
# The legal time in the UK outside of summer time is definitely GMT, not UTC;
# see Lord Tanlaw's speech
# https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo970611/text/70611-10.htm#70611-10_head0
# (Lords Hansard 11 June 1997 columns 964 to 976).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
#
# For lack of other data, follow Shanks & Pottenger for Eire in 1940-1948.
#
# Given Ilieve and Myers's data, the following claims by Shanks & Pottenger
# are incorrect:
#     * Wales did not switch from GMT to daylight saving time until
#	1921 Apr 3, when they began to conform with the rest of Great Britain.
# Actually, Wales was identical after 1880.
#     * Eire had two transitions on 1916 Oct 1.
# It actually just had one transition.
#     * Northern Ireland used single daylight saving time throughout WW II.
# Actually, it conformed to Britain.
#     * GB-Eire changed standard time to 1 hour ahead of GMT on 1968-02-18.
# Actually, that date saw the usual switch to summer time.
# Standard time was not changed until 1968-10-27 (the clocks didn't change).
#
# Here is another incorrect claim by Shanks & Pottenger:
#     * Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man did not switch from GMT
#	to daylight saving time until 1921 Apr 3, when they began to
#	conform with Great Britain.
# S.R.&O. 1916, No. 382 and HO 45/10811/312364 (quoted above) say otherwise.
#
# The following claim by Shanks & Pottenger is possible though doubtful;
# we'll ignore it for now.
#     * Dublin's 1971-10-31 switch was at 02:00, even though London's was 03:00.

# From Paul Eggert (2017-12-04):
#
# Dunsink Observatory (8 km NW of Dublin's center) was to Dublin as
# Greenwich was to London.  For example:
#
#   "Timeball on the ballast office is down.  Dunsink time."
#   -- James Joyce, Ulysses
#
# The abbreviation DMT stood for "Dublin Mean Time" or "Dunsink Mean Time";
# this being Ireland, opinions differed.
#
# Whitman says Dublin/Dunsink Mean Time was UT-00:25:21, which agrees
# with measurements of recent visitors to the Meridian Room of Dunsink
# Observatory; see Malone D. Dunsink and timekeeping. 2016-01-24.
# <https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwmalone/time/dunsink.html>.  Malone
# writes that the Nautical Almanac listed UT-00:25:22 until 1896, when
# it moved to UT-00:25:21.1 (I confirmed that the 1893 edition used
# the former and the 1896 edition used the latter).  Evidently the
# news of this change propagated slowly, as Milne 1899 still lists
# UT-00:25:22 and cites the International Telegraph Bureau.  As it is
# not clear that there was any practical significance to the change
# from UT-00:25:22 to UT-00:25:21.1 in civil timekeeping, omit this
# transition for now and just use the latter value.

# "Countess Markievicz ... claimed that the [1916] abolition of Dublin Mean Time
# was among various actions undertaken by the 'English' government that
# would 'put the whole country into the SF (Sinn Féin) camp'.  She claimed
# Irish 'public feeling (was) outraged by forcing of English time on us'."
# -- Parsons M. Dublin lost its time zone - and 25 minutes - after 1916 Rising.

#
# [These are all relative to the root, e.g., the first is
# <http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZA13Y1923.html>.]
#
# (These are those I found, but there could be more.  In any case these
# should allow various updates to the comments in the europe file to cover
# the laws applicable in Ireland.)
#
# (Note that the time in the Republic of Ireland since 1968 has been defined
# in terms of standard time being GMT+1 with a period of winter time when it
# is GMT, rather than standard time being GMT with a period of summer time
# being GMT+1.)

# From Paul Eggert (1999-03-28):
# Clive Feather (<news:859845706.26043.0@office.demon.net>, 1997-03-31)
# reports that Folkestone (Cheriton) Shuttle Terminal uses Concession Time
# (CT), equivalent to French civil time.
# Julian Hill (<news:36118128.5A14@virgin.net>, 1998-09-30) reports that
# trains between Dollands Moor (the freight facility next door)
# and Frethun run in CT.
# My admittedly uninformed guess is that the terminal has two authorities,
# the French concession operators and the British civil authorities,
# and that the time depends on who you're talking to.
# If, say, the British police were called to the station for some reason,
# I would expect the official police report to use GMT/BST and not CET/CEST.
# This is a borderline case, but for now let's stick to GMT/BST.

# From an anonymous contributor (1996-06-02):
# The law governing time in Ireland is under Statutory Instrument SI 395/94,
# which gives force to European Union 7th Council Directive No. 94/21/EC.
# Under this directive, the Minister for Justice in Ireland makes appropriate
# regulations. I spoke this morning with the Secretary of the Department of
# Justice (tel +353 1 678 9711) who confirmed to me that the correct name is
# "Irish Summer Time", abbreviated to "IST".
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-12-07):
# The 1996 anonymous contributor's goal was to determine the correct
# abbreviation for summer time in Dublin and so the contributor
# focused on the "IST", not on the "Irish Summer Time".  Though the
# "IST" was correct, the "Irish Summer Time" appears to have been an
# error, as Ireland's Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971 states that
# standard time in Ireland remains at UT +01 and is observed in
# summer, and that Greenwich mean time is observed in winter.  (Thanks
# to Derick Rethans for pointing out the error.)  That is, when
# Ireland amended the 1968 act that established UT +01 as Irish
# Standard Time, it left standard time unchanged and established GMT
# as a negative daylight saving time in winter.  So, in this database
# IST stands for Irish Summer Time for timestamps before 1968, and for
# Irish Standard Time after that.  See:

# From Paul Eggert (2018-02-15):
# In January 2018 we discovered that the negative SAVE values in the
# Eire rules cause problems with tests for ICU:
# https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-January/025825.html
# and with tests for OpenJDK:
# https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-January/025822.html
#
# To work around this problem, the build procedure can translate the
# following data into two forms, one with negative SAVE values and the
# other form with a traditional approximation for Irish timestamps
# after 1971-10-31 02:00 UTC; although this approximation has tm_isdst
# flags that are reversed, its UTC offsets are correct and this often
# suffices....
#
# The following is like GB-Eire and EU, except with standard time in
# summer and negative daylight saving time in winter.  It is for when
# negative SAVE values are used.

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2008-07-13):
#
# I found what is probably a typo of 2:00 which should perhaps be 2:00s
# in the C-Eur rule from tz database version 2008d (this part was
# corrected in version 2008d). The circumstantial evidence is simply the
# tz database itself, as seen below:
#
# Zone Europe/Paris ...
#    0:00 France WE%sT 1945 Sep 16  3:00
#
# Zone Europe/Monaco ...
#    0:00 France WE%sT 1945 Sep 16  3:00
#
# Zone Europe/Belgrade ...
#    1:00 1:00 CEST 1945 Sep 16  2:00s

# Rule France 1945 only - Sep 16  3:00 0 -
# Rule Belgium 1945 only - Sep 16  2:00s 0 -
# Rule Neth 1945 only - Sep 16 2:00s 0 -
#
# The rule line to be changed is:
#
# Rule C-Eur 1945 only - Sep 16  2:00 0 -
#
# It seems that Paris, Monaco, Rule France, Rule Belgium all agree on
# 2:00 standard time, e.g. 3:00 local time.  However there are no
# countries that use C-Eur rules in September 1945, so the only items
# affected are apparently these fictitious zones that translate acronyms
# CET and MET:
#
# Zone CET  1:00 C-Eur CE%sT
# Zone MET  1:00 C-Eur ME%sT
#
# It this is right then the corrected version would look like:

# Ministers of the USSR from 1988-01-04 No. 5 and the Act of the
# Council of Ministers of the USSR from 1989-03-14 No. 227.
#
# I did not find full texts of these acts.  For the 1989 one we have
# title at https://base.garant.ru/70754136/ :
# "About change in calculation of time on the territories of
# Lithuanian SSR, Latvian SSR and Estonian SSR, Astrakhan,
# Kaliningrad, Kirov, Kuybyshev, Ulyanovsk and Uralsk oblasts".
# And http://astrozet.net/files/Zones/DOC/RU/1980-925.txt appears to
# contain quotes from both acts: Since last Sunday of March 1988 rules
# of the second time belt are installed in Volgograd and Saratov
# oblasts.  Since last Sunday of March 1989:
# a) Lithuanian SSR, Latvian SSR, Estonian SSR, Kaliningrad oblast:
# second time belt rules without extra hour (Moscow-1);
# b) Astrakhan, Kirov, Kuybyshev, Ulyanovsk oblasts: second time belt
# rules (Moscow time)
# c) Uralsk oblast: third time belt rules (Moscow+1).

# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-27):
# Unamended version of the act of the
# Government of the Russian Federation No. 23 from 08.01.1992
# http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?docbody=&nd=102014034&rdk=0
# says that every year clocks were to be moved forward on last Sunday
# of March at 2 hours and moved backwards on last Sunday of September
# at 3 hours.  It was amended in 1996 to replace September with October.

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-06-14):
# According to Kremlin press service, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
# signed a federal law "On calculation of time" on June 9, 2011.
# According to the law Russia is abolishing daylight saving time.

# to be standard.

# Previous editions of this database used abbreviations like MET DST
# for Central European Summer Time, but this didn't agree with common usage.

# From Markus Kuhn (1996-07-12):
# The official German names ... are
#
#	Mitteleuropäische Zeit (MEZ)         = UTC+01:00
#	Mitteleuropäische Sommerzeit (MESZ)  = UTC+02:00
#
# as defined in the German Time Act (Gesetz über die Zeitbestimmung (ZeitG),
# 1978-07-25, Bundesgesetzblatt, Jahrgang 1978, Teil I, S. 1110-1111)....

#
# ... I received today an answer letter from Dr. Peter Hetzel, head of the PTB
# department for time and frequency transmission.  He explained that the
# PTB translates MEZ and MESZ into English as
#
#	Central European Time (CET)         = UTC+01:00
#	Central European Summer Time (CEST) = UTC+02:00

# The exposition in the web page
# https://www.bestor.be/wiki/index.php/Voyager_dans_le_temps._L%E2%80%99introduction_de_la_norme_de_Greenwich_en_Belgique
# gives several contemporary sources from which one can conclude that
# the switch in Europe/Brussels on 1892-05-01 was from 00:17:30 to 00:00:00.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2019-08-28):
# This quote helps explain the late-1914 situation:
#   In early November 1914, the Germans imposed the time zone used in central
#   Europe and forced the inhabitants to set their watches and public clocks
#   sixty minutes ahead.  Many were reluctant to accept "German time" and
#   continued to use "Belgian time" among themselves.  Reflecting the spirit of
#   resistance that arose in the population, a song made fun of this change....
# The song ended:
#   Putting your clock forward
#   Will but hasten the happy hour
#   When we kick out the Boches!

# Greenland
#
# From Paul Eggert (2004-10-31):
# During World War II, Germany maintained secret manned weather stations in
# East Greenland and Franz Josef Land, but we don't know their time zones.
# My source for this is Wilhelm Dege's book mentioned under Svalbard.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-12-10):
# Greenland joined the European Communities as part of Denmark,
# obtained home rule on 1979-05-01, and left the European Communities
# on 1985-02-01.  It therefore should have been using EU
# rules at least through 1984.  Shanks & Pottenger say Scoresbysund and Godthåb
# used C-Eur rules after 1980, but IATA SSIM (1991/1996) says they use EU
# rules since at least 1991.  Assume EU rules since 1980.

# From Gwillim Law (2001-06-06), citing
# <http://www.statkart.no/efs/efshefter/2001/efs5-2001.pdf> (2001-03-15),
# and with translations corrected by Steffen Thorsen:
#
# Greenland has four local times, and the relation to UTC
# is according to the following time line:
#
# The military zone near Thule	UTC-4
# Standard Greenland time	UTC-3
# Scoresbysund			UTC-1
# Danmarkshavn			UTC
#
# In the military area near Thule and in Danmarkshavn DST will not be
# introduced.

# From Rives McDow (2001-11-01):
#
# I correspond regularly with the Dansk Polarcenter, and wrote them at
# the time to clarify the situation in Thule.  Unfortunately, I have
# not heard back from them regarding my recent letter.  [But I have
# info from earlier correspondence.]
#
# According to the center, a very small local time zone around Thule
# Air Base keeps the time according to UTC-4, implementing daylight
# savings using North America rules, changing the time at 02:00 local time....
#
# The east coast of Greenland north of the community of Scoresbysund
# uses UTC in the same way as in Iceland, year round, with no dst.
# There are just a few stations on this coast, including the
# Danmarkshavn ICAO weather station mentioned in your September 29th
# email.  The other stations are two sledge patrol stations in
# Mestersvig and Daneborg, the air force base at Station Nord, and the
# DPC research station at Zackenberg.
#
# Scoresbysund and two small villages nearby keep time UTC-1 and use
# the same daylight savings time period as in West Greenland (Godthåb).
#
# The rest of Greenland, including Godthåb (this area, although it
# includes central Greenland, is known as west Greenland), keeps time
# UTC-3, with daylight savings methods according to European rules.
#
# It is common procedure to use UTC 0 in the wilderness of East and
# North Greenland, because it is mainly Icelandic aircraft operators
# maintaining traffic in these areas.  However, the official status of
# this area is that it sticks with Godthåb time.  This area might be
# considered a dual time zone in some respects because of this.

# From Rives McDow (2001-11-19):
# I heard back from someone stationed at Thule; the time change took place
# there at 2:00 AM.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# From 1997 on the CIA map shows Danmarkshavn on GMT;
# the 1995 map as like Godthåb.
# For lack of better info, assume they were like Godthåb before 1996.
# startkart.no says Thule does not observe DST, but this is clearly an error,
# so go with Shanks & Pottenger for Thule transitions until this year.
# For 2007 on assume Thule will stay in sync with US DST rules.

# From J William Piggott (2016-02-20):
# "Greenland north of the community of Scoresbysund" is officially named
# "National Park" by Executive Order:
# http://naalakkersuisut.gl/~/media/Nanoq/Files/Attached%20Files/Engelske-tekster/Legislation/Executive%20Order%20National%20Park.rtf
# It is their only National Park.

# From Jonas Nyrup (2022-11-24):
# On last Saturday in October 2023 when DST ends America/Nuuk will switch
# from -03/-02 to -02/-01

# https://ina.gl/samlinger/oversigt-over-samlinger/samling/dagsordener/dagsorden.aspx?lang=da&day=24-11-2022
#
# From Thomas M. Steenholdt (2022-12-02):
# - The bill to move America/Nuuk from UTC-03 to UTC-02 passed.
# - The bill to stop observing DST did not (Greenland will stop observing DST
#   when EU does).
# Details on the implementation are here (section 6):
# https://ina.gl/dvd/EM%202022/pdf/media/2553529/pkt17_em2022_tidens_bestemmelse_bem_da.pdf
# This is how the change will be implemented:
# 1. The shift *to* DST in 2023 happens as normal.
# 2. The shift *from* DST in 2023 happens as normal, but coincides with the
#    shift to UTC-02 normaltime (people will not change their clocks here).
# 3. After this, DST is still observed, but as -02/-01 instead of -03/-02.

#
# From Paul Eggert (2016-03-18):
# The 1989 transition is from USSR act No. 227 (1989-03-14).
#
# From Peter Ilieve (1994-10-15):
# A relative in Tallinn confirms the accuracy of the data for 1989 onwards
# [through 1994] and gives the legal authority for it,
# a regulation of the Government of Estonia, No. 111 of 1989....
#
# From Peter Ilieve (1996-10-28):
# [IATA SSIM (1992/1996) claims that the Baltic republics switch at 01:00s,
# but a relative confirms that Estonia still switches at 02:00s, writing:]
# "I do not [know] exactly but there are some little different
# (confusing) rules for International Air and Railway Transport Schedules
# conversion in Sunday connected with end of summer time in Estonia....
# A discussion is running about the summer time efficiency and effect on
# human physiology.  It seems that Estonia maybe will not change to
# summer time next spring."

# From Peter Ilieve (1998-11-04), heavily edited:
# The 1998-09-22 Estonian time law
# http://trip.rk.ee/cgi-bin/thw?${BASE}=akt&${OOHTML}=rtd&TA=1998&TO=1&AN=1390
# refers to the Eighth Directive and cites the association agreement between
# the EU and Estonia, ratified by the Estonian law (RT II 1995, 22-27, 120).
#
# I also asked [my relative] whether they use any standard abbreviation
# for their standard and summer times. He says no, they use "suveaeg"
# (summer time) and "talveaeg" (winter time).

# From The Baltic Times <https://www.baltictimes.com/> (1999-09-09)
# via Steffen Thorsen:
# This year will mark the last time Estonia shifts to summer time,
# a council of the ruling coalition announced Sept. 6....
# But what this could mean for Estonia's chances of joining the European
# Union are still unclear.  In 1994, the EU declared summer time compulsory
# for all member states until 2001.  Brussels has yet to decide what to do
# after that.

# From Mart Oruaas (2000-01-29):
# Regulation No. 301 (1999-10-12) obsoletes previous regulation
# No. 206 (1998-09-22) and thus sticks Estonia to +02:00 GMT for all
# the year round.  The regulation is effective 1999-11-01.

# From Toomas Soome (2002-02-21):
# The Estonian government has changed once again timezone politics.
# Now we are using again EU rules.
#
# From Urmet Jänes (2002-03-28):
# The legislative reference is Government decree No. 84 on 2002-02-21.

# Finland

# From Hannu Strang (1994-09-25 06:03:37 UTC):
# Well, here in Helsinki we're just changing from summer time to regular one,
# and it's supposed to change at 4am...

# From Janne Snabb (2010-07-15):
#
# I noticed that the Finland data is not accurate for years 1981 and 1982.
# During these two first trial years the DST adjustment was made one hour
# earlier than in forthcoming years. Starting 1983 the adjustment was made
# according to the central European standards.
#
# This is documented in Heikki Oja: Aikakirja 2007, published by The Almanac
# Office of University of Helsinki, ISBN 952-10-3221-9, available online (in
# Finnish) at
# https://almanakka.helsinki.fi/aikakirja/Aikakirja2007kokonaan.pdf
#
# Page 105 (56 in PDF version) has a handy table of all past daylight savings
# transitions. It is easy enough to interpret without Finnish skills.
#
# This is also confirmed by Finnish Broadcasting Company's archive at:

#
# The news clip from 1981 says that "the time between 2 and 3 o'clock does not

# was published on 1891-03-15, so it could only take force on 1891-03-16.

# From Michael Deckers (2020-06-10):
# Le Gaulois, 1911-03-11, page 1/6, online at
# https://www.retronews.fr/societe/echo-de-presse/2018/01/29/1911-change-lheure-de-paris
# ... [ Instantly, all pressure driven clock dials halted...  Nine minutes and
#       twenty-one seconds later the hands resumed their circular motion. ]
# There are also precise reports about how the change was prepared in train
# stations: all the publicly visible clocks stopped at midnight railway time
# (or were covered), only the chief of service had a watch, labeled
# "Heure ancienne", that he kept running until it reached 00:04:21, when
# he announced "Heure nouvelle".  See the "Le Petit Journal 1911-03-11".
# https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6192911/f1.item.zoom
#
# From Michael Deckers (2020-06-12):
# That "all French clocks stopped" for 00:09:21 is a misreading of French
# newspapers; this sort of adjustment applies only to certain
# remote-controlled clocks ("pendules pneumatiques", of which there existed
# perhaps a dozen in Paris, and which simply could not be set back remotely),
# but not to all the clocks in all French towns and villages.  For instance,
# the following story in the "Courrier de Saône-et-Loire" 1911-03-11, page 2:
# only works if legal time was stepped back (was not monotone): ...
#   [One can observe that children who had been born at midnight less 5
#    minutes and who had died at midnight of the old time, would turn out to
#    be dead before being born, time having been set back and having
#    suppressed 9 minutes and 25 seconds of their existence, that is, more
#    than they could spend.]
#
# From Paul Eggert (2020-06-12):
# French time in railway stations was legally five minutes behind civil time,
# which explains why railway "old time" ran to 00:04:21 instead of to 00:09:21.
# The law's text (which Michael Deckers noted is at
# <https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2022333z/f2>) says only that
# at 1911-03-11 00:00 legal time was that of Paris mean time delayed by
# nine minutes and twenty-one seconds, and does not say how the
# transition from Paris mean time was to occur.
#
# tzdb has no way to represent stopped clocks.  As the railway practice
# was to keep a watch running on "old time" to decide when to restart
# the other clocks, this could be modeled as a transition for "old time" at
# 00:09:21.  However, since the law was ambiguous and clocks outside railway
# stations were probably done haphazardly with the popular impression being
# that the transition was done at 00:00 "old time", simply leave the time
# blank; this causes zic to default to 00:00 "old time" which is good enough.
# Do something similar for the 1891-03-16 transition.  There are similar
# problems in Algiers, Monaco and Tunis.

#
# Shank & Pottenger seem to use '24:00' ambiguously; resolve it with Whitman.

# From Markus Kuhn (1998-09-29):
# The German time zone web site by the Physikalisch-Technische
# Bundesanstalt contains DST information back to 1916.
# [See tz-link.html for the URL.]

# From Jörg Schilling (2002-10-23):
# In 1945, Berlin was switched to Moscow Summer time (GMT+4) by
# https://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/biografien/BersarinNikolai/
# General [Nikolai] Bersarin.

# From Paul Eggert (2003-03-08):
# http://www.parlament-berlin.de/pds-fraktion.nsf/727459127c8b66ee8525662300459099/defc77cb784f180ac1256c2b0030274b/$FILE/bersarint.pdf
# says that Bersarin issued an order to use Moscow time on May 20.
# However, Moscow did not observe daylight saving in 1945, so
# this was equivalent to UT +03, not +04.

# Svalbard & Jan Mayen

# From Steffen Thorsen (2001-05-01):
# Although I could not find it explicitly, it seems that Jan Mayen and
# Svalbard have been using the same time as Norway at least since the
# time they were declared as parts of Norway.  Svalbard was declared
# as a part of Norway by law of 1925-07-17 no 11, section 4 and Jan
# Mayen by law of 1930-02-27 no 2, section 2. (From
# <http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-19250717-011.html> and
# <http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-19300227-002.html>).  The law/regulation
# for normal/standard time in Norway is from 1894-06-29 no 1 (came
# into operation on 1895-01-01) and Svalbard/Jan Mayen seem to be a
# part of this law since 1925/1930. (From
# <http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-18940629-001.html>) I have not been
# able to find if Jan Mayen used a different time zone (e.g. -0100)
# before 1930. Jan Mayen has only been "inhabited" since 1921 by
# Norwegian meteorologists and maybe used the same time as Norway ever
# since 1921.  Svalbard (Arctic/Longyearbyen) has been inhabited since
# before 1895, and therefore probably changed the local time somewhere
# between 1895 and 1925 (inclusive).

# From Paul Eggert (2013-09-04):
#
# Actually, Jan Mayen was never occupied by Germany during World War II,
# so it must have diverged from Oslo time during the war, as Oslo was
# keeping Berlin time.
#
# <https://www.jan-mayen.no/history.htm> says that the meteorologists
# burned down their station in 1940 and left the island, but returned in
# 1941 with a small Norwegian garrison and continued operations despite
# frequent air attacks from Germans.  In 1943 the Americans established a
# radiolocating station on the island, called "Atlantic City".  Possibly
# the UT offset changed during the war, but I think it unlikely that
# Jan Mayen used German daylight-saving rules.
#
# Svalbard is more complicated, as it was raided in August 1941 by an
# Allied party that evacuated the civilian population to England (says
# <http://www.bartleby.com/65/sv/Svalbard.html>).  The Svalbard FAQ
# <http://www.svalbard.com/SvalbardFAQ.html> says that the Germans were
# expelled on 1942-05-14.  However, small parties of Germans did return,
# and according to Wilhelm Dege's book "War North of 80" (1954)
# http://www.ucalgary.ca/UofC/departments/UP/1-55238/1-55238-110-2.html
# the German armed forces at the Svalbard weather station code-named
# Haudegen did not surrender to the Allies until September 1945.
#
# All these events predate our cutoff date of 1970, so use Europe/Berlin
# for these regions.

# Italy
# San Marino
# Vatican City
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
# Sicily and Sardinia each had their own time zones from 1866 to 1893,
# called Palermo Time (+00:53:28) and Cagliari Time (+00:36:32).
# During World War II, German-controlled Italy used German time.
# But these events all occurred before the 1970 cutoff,
# so record only the time in Rome.
#
# From Stephen Trainor (2019-05-06):
# http://www.ac-ilsestante.it/MERIDIANE/ora_legale/ORA_LEGALE_ESTIVA_IN_ITALIA.htm
# ... the [1866] law went into effect on 12 December 1866, rather than
# the date of the decree (22 Sep 1866)
# https://web.archive.org/web/20070824155341/http://www.iav.it/planetario/didastro/didastro/english.htm
# ... "In Italy in 1866 there were 6 railway times (Torino, Verona, Firenze,
# Roma, Napoli, Palermo). On that year it was decided to unify them, adopting
# the average time of Rome (even if this city was not yet part of the
# kingdom).  On the 12th December 1866, on the starting of the winter time
# table, it took effect in the railways, the post office and the telegraph,
# not only for the internal service but also for the public....  Milano set
# the public watches on the Rome time on the same day (12th December 1866),
# Torino and Bologna on the 1st January 1867, Venezia the 1st May 1880 and the
# last city was Cagliari in 1886."
#
# From Luigi Rosa (2019-05-07):
# this is the scan of the decree:
# http://www.radiomarconi.com/marconi/filopanti/1866c.jpg
#
# From Michael Deckers (2016-10-24):
# http://www.ac-ilsestante.it/MERIDIANE/ora_legale quotes a law of 1893-08-10
# ... [translated as] "The preceding dispositions will enter into
# force at the instant at which, according to the time specified in
# the 1st article, the 1st of November 1893 will begin...."
#
# From Pierpaolo Bernardi (2016-10-20):
# The authoritative source for time in Italy is the national metrological
# institute, which has a summary page of historical DST data at
# http://www.inrim.it/res/tf/ora_legale_i.shtml
# [now at http://oldsite.inrim.it/res/tf/ora_legale_i.shtml as of 2017]
# (2016-10-24):
# http://www.renzobaldini.it/le-ore-legali-in-italia/
# has still different data for 1944.  It divides Italy in two, as
# there were effectively two governments at the time, north of Gothic
# Line German controlled territory, official government RSI, and south
# of the Gothic Line, controlled by allied armies.
#
# From Brian Inglis (2016-10-23):
# Viceregal LEGISLATIVE DECREE. 14 September 1944, no. 219.
# Restoration of Standard Time. (044U0219) (OJ 62 of 30.9.1944) ...
# Given the R. law decreed on 1944-03-29, no. 92, by which standard time is
# advanced to sixty minutes later starting at hour two on 1944-04-02; ...
# Starting at hour three on the date 1944-09-17 standard time will be resumed.
#
# From Alois Treindl (2019-07-02):
# I spent 6 Euros to buy two archive copies of Il Messaggero, a Roman paper,
# for 1 and 2 April 1944.  The edition of 2 April has this note: "Tonight at 2
# am, put forward the clock by one hour.  Remember that in the night between
# today and Monday the 'ora legale' will come in force again."  That makes it
# clear that in Rome the change was on Monday, 3 April 1944 at 2 am.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2021-10-05):
# Go with INRiM for DST rules, except as corrected by Inglis for 1944
# for the Kingdom of Italy.  This is consistent with Renzo Baldini.
# Model Rome's occupation by using C-Eur rules from 1943-09-10
# to 1944-06-04; although Rome was an open city during this period, it
# was effectively controlled by Germany.  Using C-Eur is consistent
# with Treindl's comment about Rome in April 1944, as the "Rule Italy"
# lines during German occupation do not affect Europe/Rome
# (though they do affect Europe/Malta).

# Latvia

# From Liene Kanepe (1998-09-17):

# I asked about this matter Scientific Secretary of the Institute of Astronomy
# of The University of Latvia Dr. paed Mr. Ilgonis Vilks. I also searched the
# correct data in juridical acts and I found some juridical documents about
# changes in the counting of time in Latvia from 1981....
#
# Act No. 35 of the Council of Ministers of Latvian SSR of 1981-01-22 ...
# according to the Act No. 925 of the Council of Ministers of USSR of 1980-10-24
# ...: all year round the time of 2nd time zone + 1 hour, in addition turning
# the hands of the clock 1 hour forward on 1 April at 00:00 (GMT 31 March 21:00)
# and 1 hour backward on the 1 October at 00:00 (GMT 30 September 20:00).
#
# Act No. 592 of the Council of Ministers of Latvian SSR of 1984-09-24 ...
# according to the Act No. 967 of the Council of Ministers of USSR of 1984-09-13
# ...: all year round the time of 2nd time zone + 1 hour, in addition turning
# the hands of the clock 1 hour forward on the last Sunday of March at 02:00
# (GMT 23:00 on the previous day) and 1 hour backward on the last Sunday of
# September at 03:00 (GMT 23:00 on the previous day).
#
# Act No. 81 of the Council of Ministers of Latvian SSR of 1989-03-22 ...
# according to the Act No. 227 of the Council of Ministers of USSR of 1989-03-14
# ...: since the last Sunday of March 1989 in Lithuanian SSR, Latvian SSR,
# Estonian SSR and Kaliningrad region of Russian Federation all year round the
# time of 2nd time zone (Moscow time minus one hour). On the territory of Latvia
# transition to summer time is performed on the last Sunday of March at 02:00
# (GMT 00:00), turning the hands of the clock 1 hour forward.  The end of
# daylight saving time is performed on the last Sunday of September at 03:00
# (GMT 00:00), turning the hands of the clock 1 hour backward. Exception is
# 1989-03-26, when we must not turn the hands of the clock....
#
# The Regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia of
# 1997-01-21 on transition to Summer time ... established the same order of
# daylight savings time settings as in the States of the European Union.

# From Andrei Ivanov (2000-03-06):
# This year Latvia will not switch to Daylight Savings Time (as specified in
# The Regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Rep. of Latvia of
# 29-Feb-2000 (No. 79) <http://www.lv-laiks.lv/wwwraksti/2000/071072/vd4.htm>,
# in Latvian for subscribers only).

# From RFE/RL Newsline
# http://www.rferl.org/newsline/2001/01/3-CEE/cee-030101.html
# (2001-01-03), noted after a heads-up by Rives McDow:
# The Latvian government on 2 January decided that the country will
# institute daylight-saving time this spring, LETA reported.
# Last February the three Baltic states decided not to turn back their
# clocks one hour in the spring....
# Minister of Economy Aigars Kalvītis noted that Latvia had too few
# daylight hours and thus decided to comply with a draft European
# Commission directive that provides for instituting daylight-saving
# time in EU countries between 2002 and 2006. The Latvian government
# urged Lithuania and Estonia to adopt a similar time policy, but it
# appears that they will not do so....

# Lithuania

# From Paul Eggert (2016-03-18):
# The 1989 transition is from USSR act No. 227 (1989-03-14).

# From Paul Eggert (1996-11-22):
# IATA SSIM (1992/1996) says Lithuania uses W-Eur rules, but since it is
# known to be wrong about Estonia and Latvia, assume it's wrong here too.

# From Marius Gedminas (1998-08-07):
# I would like to inform that in this year Lithuanian time zone
# (Europe/Vilnius) was changed.

# From ELTA No. 972 (2582) (1999-09-29) <http://www.elta.lt/>,
# via Steffen Thorsen:
# Lithuania has shifted back to the second time zone (GMT plus two hours)
# to be valid here starting from October 31,
# as decided by the national government on Wednesday....
# The Lithuanian government also announced plans to consider a
# motion to give up shifting to summer time in spring, as it was
# already done by Estonia.

# From the Fact File, Lithuanian State Department of Tourism
# <http://www.tourism.lt/informa/ff.htm> (2000-03-27):
# Local time is GMT+2 hours ..., no daylight saving.

# From a user via Klaus Marten (2003-02-07):
# As a candidate for membership of the European Union, Lithuania will
# observe Summer Time in 2003, changing its clocks at the times laid
# down in EU Directive 2000/84 of 19.I.01 (i.e. at the same times as its
# neighbour Latvia). The text of the Lithuanian government Order of
# 7.XI.02 to this effect can be found at

# Moldova

# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-07):
# the act of the government of the Republic of Moldova Nr. 132 from 1990-05-04
# http://lex.justice.md/viewdoc.php?action=view&view=doc&id=298782&lang=2
# ... says that since 1990-05-06 on the territory of the Moldavian SSR
# time would be calculated as the standard time of the second time belt
# plus one hour of the "summer" time. To implement that clocks would be
# adjusted one hour backwards at 1990-05-06 2:00. After that "summer"
# time would be cancelled last Sunday of September at 3:00 and
# reintroduced last Sunday of March at 2:00.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# A previous version of this database followed Shanks & Pottenger, who write
# that Tiraspol switched to Moscow time on 1992-01-19 at 02:00.
# However, this is most likely an error, as Moldova declared independence
# on 1991-08-27 (the 1992-01-19 date is that of a Russian decree).
# In early 1992 there was large-scale interethnic violence in the area
# and it's possible that some Russophones continued to observe Moscow time.
# But [two people] separately reported via
# Jesper Nørgaard that as of 2001-01-24 Tiraspol was like Chisinau.
# The Tiraspol entry has therefore been removed for now.
#
# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-10-17):
# Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR, also known as
# "Pridnestrovie") has abolished seasonal clock change (no transition
# to the Winter Time).
#
# News (in Russian):
# http://www.kyivpost.ua/russia/news/pridnestrove-otkazalos-ot-perehoda-na-zimnee-vremya-30954.html
# http://www.allmoldova.com/moldova-news/1249064116.html
#
# The substance of this change (reinstatement of the Tiraspol entry)
# is from a patch from Petr Machata (2011-10-17)
#
# From Tim Parenti (2011-10-19)
# In addition, being situated at +4651+2938 would give Tiraspol
# a pre-1880 LMT offset of 1:58:32.
#
# (which agrees with the earlier entry that had been removed)
#
# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-10-26)
# NO need to divide Moldova into two timezones at this point.
# As of today, Transnistria (Pridnestrovie)- Tiraspol reversed its own
# decision to abolish DST this winter.
# Following Moldova and neighboring Ukraine- Transnistria (Pridnestrovie)-
# Tiraspol will go back to winter time on October 30, 2011.
# News from Moldova (in russian):

# From Roman Tudos (2015-07-02):
# http://lex.justice.md/index.php?action=view&view=doc&lang=1&id=355077
# From Paul Eggert (2015-07-01):
# The abovementioned official link to IGO1445-868/2014 states that
# 2014-10-26's fallback transition occurred at 03:00 local time.  Also,
# https://www.trm.md/en/social/la-30-martie-vom-trece-la-ora-de-vara
# says the 2014-03-30 spring-forward transition was at 02:00 local time.
# Guess that since 1997 Moldova has switched one hour before the EU.

# Portugal

# From Paul Eggert (2014-08-11), after a heads-up from Stephen Colebourne:
# According to a Portuguese decree (1911-05-26)
# https://dre.pt/application/dir/pdf1sdip/1911/05/12500/23132313.pdf
# Lisbon was at -0:36:44.68, but switched to GMT on 1912-01-01 at 00:00.
#
# From Michael Deckers (2018-02-15):
# article 5 [of the 1911 decree; Deckers's translation] ...:
# These dispositions shall enter into force at the instant at which,
# according to the 2nd article, the civil day January 1, 1912 begins,
# all clocks therefore having to be advanced or set back correspondingly ...

# From Rui Pedro Salgueiro (1992-11-12):
# Portugal has recently (September, 27) changed timezone
# (from WET to MET or CET) to harmonize with EEC.
#
# Martin Bruckmann (1996-02-29) reports via Peter Ilieve
# that Portugal is reverting to 0:00 by not moving its clocks this spring.
# The new Prime Minister was fed up with getting up in the dark in the winter.
#
# From Paul Eggert (1996-11-12):
# IATA SSIM (1991-09) reports several 1991-09 and 1992-09 transitions
# at 02:00u, not 01:00u.  Assume that these are typos.
# IATA SSIM (1991/1992) reports that the Azores were at -1:00.
# IATA SSIM (1993-02) says +0:00; later issues (through 1996-09) say -1:00.
# Guess that the Azores changed to EU rules in 1992 (since that's when Portugal
# harmonized with EU rules), and that they stayed +0:00 that winter.

# Russia

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-09-15):
# Based on last Russian Government Decree No. 725 on August 31, 2011
# (Government document
# http://www.government.ru/gov/results/16355/print/
# in Russian)
# there are few corrections have to be made for some Russian time zones...
# All updated Russian Time Zones were placed in table and translated to English
# by WorldTimeZone.com at the link below:
# http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_russia36.htm

# From Sanjeev Gupta (2011-09-27):
# Scans of [Decree No. 23 of January 8, 1992] are available at:
# http://government.consultant.ru/page.aspx?1223966
# They are in Cyrillic letters (presumably Russian).

# From Arthur David Olson (2012-05-09):
# Regarding the instant when clocks in time-zone-shifting parts of Russia
# changed in September 2011:
#
# One source is
# http://government.ru/gov/results/16355/
# which, according to translate.google.com, begins "Decree of August 31,
# 2011 No. 725" and contains no other dates or "effective date" information.
#
# Another source is
# https://rg.ru/2011/09/06/chas-zona-dok.html
# which, according to translate.google.com, begins "Resolution of the
# Government of the Russian Federation on August 31, 2011 N 725" and also
# contains "Date first official publication: September 6, 2011 Posted on:
# in the 'RG' - Federal Issue No. 5573 September 6, 2011" but which
# does not contain any "effective date" information.
#
# Another source is
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oymyakonsky_District#cite_note-RuTime-7
# which, in note 8, contains "Resolution No. 725 of August 31, 2011...
# Effective as of after 7 days following the day of the official publication"
# but which does not contain any reference to September 6, 2011.
#
# The Wikipedia article refers to
# http://base.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi?req=doc;base=LAW;n=118896
# which seems to copy the text of the government.ru page.
#
# Tobias Conradi combines Wikipedia's
# "as of after 7 days following the day of the official publication"
# with www.rg.ru's "Date of first official publication: September 6, 2011" to
# get September 13, 2011 as the cutover date (unusually, a Tuesday, as Tobias

#
# None of the sources indicates a time of day for changing clocks.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Moscow time zone abbreviations after 1919-07-01, and Moscow rules after 1991,
# are from Andrey A. Chernov.  The rest is from Shanks & Pottenger,
# except we follow Chernov's report that 1992 DST transitions were Sat
# 23:00, not Sun 02:00s.
#
# From Stanislaw A. Kuzikowski (1994-06-29):
# But now it is some months since Novosibirsk is 3 hours ahead of Moscow!
# I do not know why they have decided to make this change;
# as far as I remember it was done exactly during winter->summer switching
# so we (Novosibirsk) simply did not switch.
#
# From Andrey A. Chernov (1996-10-04):
# 'MSK' and 'MSD' were born and used initially on Moscow computers with
# UNIX-like OSes by several developer groups (e.g. Demos group, Kiae group)....
# The next step was the UUCP network, the Relcom predecessor
# (used mainly for mail), and MSK/MSD was actively used there.
#
# From Chris Carrier (1996-10-30):
# According to a friend of mine who rode the Trans-Siberian Railroad from
# Moscow to Irkutsk in 1995, public air and rail transport in Russia ...
# still follows Moscow time, no matter where in Russia it is located.
#
# For Grozny, Chechnya, we have the following story from
# John Daniszewski, "Scavengers in the Rubble", Los Angeles Times (2001-02-07):
# News - often false - is spread by word of mouth.  A rumor that it was
# time to move the clocks back put this whole city out of sync with
# the rest of Russia for two weeks - even soldiers stationed here began
# enforcing curfew at the wrong time.
#
# From Gwillim Law (2001-06-05):
# There's considerable evidence that Sakhalin Island used to be in
# UTC+11, and has changed to UTC+10, in this decade.  I start with the
# SSIM, which listed Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in zone RU10 along with Magadan
# until February 1997, and then in RU9 with Khabarovsk and Vladivostok
# since September 1997....  Although the Kuril Islands are
# administratively part of Sakhalin oblast', they appear to have
# remained on UTC+11 along with Magadan.

# this is link to order from 1956 about timezone in USSR
# http://astro.uni-altai.ru/~orion/blog/2011/11/novyie-granitsyi-chasovyih-poyasov-v-sssr/
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-07-16):
# Perhaps someone could translate the above-mentioned link and use it
# to correct our data for the ex-Soviet Union.  It cites the following:
# «Поясное время и новые границы часовых поясов» / сост. П.Н. Долгов,
# отв. ред. Г.Д. Бурдун - М: Комитет стандартов, мер и измерительных
# приборов при Совете Министров СССР, Междуведомственная комиссия
# единой службы времени, 1956 г.
# This book looks like it would be a helpful resource for the Soviet
# Union through 1956.  Although a copy was in the Scientific Library
# of Tomsk State University, I have not been able to track down a copy nearby.
#
# From Stepan Golosunov (2018-07-21):
# http://astro.uni-altai.ru/~orion/blog/2015/05/center-reforma-ischisleniya-vremeni-br-na-territorii-sssr-v-1957-godu-center/
# says that the 1956 decision to change time belts' borders was not
# implemented as planned in 1956 and the change happened in 1957.
# There is also the problem that actual time zones were different from
# the official time belts (and from many time belts' maps) as there were
# numerous exceptions to application of time belt rules.  For example,
# https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Московское_время#Перемещение_границы_применения_московского_времени_на_восток
# says that by 1962 there were many regions in the 3rd time belt that
# were on Moscow time, referring to a 1962 map.  By 1989 number of such
# exceptions grew considerably.

# From Tim Parenti (2014-07-06):
# The comments detailing the coverage of each Russian zone are meant to assist
# with maintenance only and represent our best guesses as to which regions
# are covered by each zone.  They are not meant to be taken as an authoritative
# listing.  The region codes listed come from
# https://en.wikipedia.org/w/?title=Federal_subjects_of_Russia&oldid=611810498
# and are used for convenience only; no guarantees are made regarding their
# future stability.  ISO 3166-2:RU codes are also listed for first-level
# divisions where available.

# From Paul Eggert (2019-07-25):
# Although Shanks lists 1945-01-01 as the date for transition from
# +01/+02 to +02/+03, more likely this is a placeholder.  Guess that
# the transition occurred at 1945-04-10 00:00, which is about when
# Königsberg surrendered to Soviet troops.  (Thanks to Alois Treindl.)

# From Paul Eggert (2016-03-18):
# The 1989 transition is from USSR act No. 227 (1989-03-14).

# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-07):
# http://www.rgo.ru/ru/kaliningradskoe-oblastnoe-otdelenie/ob-otdelenii/publikacii/kak-nam-zhilos-bez-letnego-vremeni
# confirms that the 1989 change to Moscow-1 was implemented.
# (The article, though, is misattributed to 1990 while saying that
# summer->winter transition would be done on the 24 of September. But
# 1990-09-24 was Monday, while 1989-09-24 was Sunday as expected.)
# ...
# http://www.kaliningradka.ru/site_pc/cherez/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=40091
# says that Kaliningrad switched to Moscow-1 on 1989-03-26, avoided
# at the last moment switch to Moscow-1 on 1991-03-31, switched to
# Moscow on 1991-11-03, switched to Moscow-1 on 1992-01-19.

# The Soviets switched to UT-based time in 1919.  Decree No. 59
# (1919-02-08) http://istmat.info/node/35567 established UT-based time
# zones, and Decree No. 147 (1919-03-29) http://istmat.info/node/35854
# specified a transition date of 1919-07-01, apparently at 00:00 UT.
# No doubt only the Soviet-controlled regions switched on that date;

# (Thanks to Alexander Belopolsky for pointers to the decrees.)

# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-07):
# 11. Regions-violators, 1981-1982.
# Wikipedia refers to
# http://maps.monetonos.ru/maps/raznoe/Old_Maps/Old_Maps/Articles/022/3_1981.html
# http://besp.narod.ru/nauka_1981_3.htm
#
# The second link provides two articles scanned from the Nauka i Zhizn
# magazine No. 3, 1981 and a scan of the short article attributed to
# the Trud newspaper from February 1982.  The first link provides the
# same Nauka i Zhizn articles converted to the text form (but misses
# time belt changes map).
#
# The second Nauka i Zhizn article says that in addition to
# introduction of summer time on 1981-04-01 there are some time belt
# border changes on 1981-10-01, mostly affecting Nenets Autonomous
# Okrug, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Yakutia, Magadan Oblast and Chukotka
# according to the provided map (colored one).  In addition to that
# "time violators" (regions which were not using rules of the time
# belts in which they were located) would not be moving off the DST on
# 1981-10-01 to restore the decree time usage.  (Komi ASSR was
# supposed to repeat that move in October 1982 to account for the 2
# hour difference.)  Map depicting "time violators" before 1981-10-01
# is also provided.
#
# The article from Trud says that 1981-10-01 changes caused problems
# and some territories would be moved to pre-1981-10-01 time by not
# moving to summer time on 1982-04-01.  Namely: Dagestan,
# Kabardino-Balkar, Kalmyk, Komi, Mari, Mordovian, North Ossetian,
# Tatar, Chechen-Ingush and Chuvash ASSR, Krasnodar and Stavropol
# krais, Arkhangelsk, Vladimir, Vologda, Voronezh, Gorky, Ivanovo,
# Kostroma, Lipetsk, Penza, Rostov, Ryazan, Tambov, Tyumen and
# Yaroslavl oblasts, Nenets and Evenk autonomous okrugs, Khatangsky
# district of Taymyr Autonomous Okrug.  As a result Evenk Autonomous
# Okrug and Khatangsky district of Taymyr Autonomous Okrug would end
# up on Moscow+4, Tyumen Oblast on Moscow+2 and the rest on Moscow
# time.
#
# http://astrozet.net/files/Zones/DOC/RU/1980-925.txt
# attributes the 1982 changes to the Act of the Council of Ministers
# of the USSR No. 126 from 18.02.1982.  1980-925.txt also adds
# Udmurtia to the list of affected territories and lists Khatangsky
# district separately from Taymyr Autonomous Okrug.  Probably erroneously.
#
# The affected territories are currently listed under Europe/Moscow,
# Asia/Yekaterinburg and Asia/Krasnoyarsk.
#
# 12. Udmurtia
# The fact that Udmurtia is depicted as a violator in the Nauka i

# change at 1992-01-19 2:00 (restoration of the decree time in Russia).

# There were some exceptions, though.

# change. (Different newspapers providing different lists. And some

#
# And apparently some exceptions were reverted in the last moment.
# http://www.kaliningradka.ru/site_pc/cherez/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=40091

# 1991-03-31 switch and one person at

# From Alois Treindl (2022-02-15):
# the Russian wikipedia page
# https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Московское_время#Перемещение_границы_применения_московского_времени_на_восток
# contains the sentence (in Google translation) "In the autumn of
# 1981, Arkhangelsk, Vologda, Yaroslavl, Ivanovo, Vladimir, Ryazan,
# Lipetsk, Voronezh, Rostov-on-Don, Krasnodar and regions to the east
# of those named (about 30 in total) parted ways with Moscow time.
# However, the convenience of common time with Moscow turned out to be
# decisive - in 1982, these regions again switched to Moscow time."
# Shanks International atlas has similar information, and also the
# Russian book Zaitsev A., Kutalev D. A new astrologer's reference
# book. Coordinates of cities and time corrections, - The World of
# Urania, 2012 (Russian: Зайцев А., Куталёв Д., Новый справочник

# To me it seems that an extra zone is needed, which starts with LMT
# util 1919, later follows Moscow since 1930, but deviates from it
# between 1 October 1981 until 1 April 1982.
#
#
# From Paul Eggert (2022-02-15):
# Given the above, we appear to be missing some Zone entries for the
# chaotic early 1980s in Russia.  It's not clear what these entries
# should be.  For now, sweep this under the rug and just document the
# time in Moscow.

# From Vladimir Karpinsky (2014-07-08):
# LMT in Moscow (before Jul 3, 1916) is 2:30:17, that was defined by Moscow
# Observatory (coordinates: 55° 45' 29.70", 37° 34' 05.30")....
# LMT in Moscow since Jul 3, 1916 is 2:31:01 as a result of new standard.
# (The info is from the book by Byalokoz ... p. 18.)
# The time in St. Petersburg as capital of Russia was defined by
# Pulkov observatory, near St. Petersburg.  In 1916 LMT Moscow
# was synchronized with LMT St. Petersburg (+30 minutes), (Pulkov observatory
# coordinates: 59° 46' 18.70", 30° 19' 40.70") so 30° 19' 40.70" >
# 2h01m18.7s = 2:01:19.  LMT Moscow = LMT St.Petersburg + 30m 2:01:19 + 0:30 =
# 2:31:19 ...
#
# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-08):
# Milne does not list Moscow, but suggests that its time might be listed in
# Résumés mensuels et annuels des observations météorologiques (1895).
# Presumably this is OCLC 85825704, a journal published with parallel text in
# Russian and French.  This source has not been located; go with Karpinsky.

# from current Russia Zone 6 - Krasnoyarsk Time Zone (KRA) UTC +0700
# to Russia Zone 5 - Novosibirsk Time Zone (NOV) UTC +0600
#
# This is according to Government of Russia decree No. 740, on September

# In the 1918 and 1919 fallback transitions in Spain, the clock for

# with a fallback transition from the second occurrence of 00:59... to

# From Alois Treindl (2008-12-17):
# I have researched the DST usage in Switzerland during the 1940ies.
#
# As I wrote in an earlier message, I suspected the current tzdata values
# to be wrong. This is now verified.
#
# I have found copies of the original ruling by the Swiss Federal
# government, in 'Eidgenössische Gesetzessammlung 1941 and 1942' (Swiss
# federal law collection)...
#
# DST began on Monday 5 May 1941, 1:00 am by shifting the clocks to 2:00 am
# DST ended on Monday 6 Oct 1941, 2:00 am by shifting the clocks to 1:00 am.
#
# DST began on Monday, 4 May 1942 at 01:00 am
# DST ended on Monday, 5 Oct 1942 at 02:00 am
#
# There was no DST in 1940, I have checked the law collection carefully.
# It is also indicated by the fact that the 1942 entry in the law
# collection points back to 1941 as a reference, but no reference to any
# other years are made.
#
# Newspaper articles I have read in the archives on 6 May 1941 reported
# about the introduction of DST (Sommerzeit in German) during the previous
# night as an absolute novelty, because this was the first time that such
# a thing had happened in Switzerland.
#
# I have also checked 1916, because one book source (Gabriel, Traité de
# l'heure dans le monde) claims that Switzerland had DST in 1916. This is
# false, no official document could be found. Probably Gabriel got misled
# by references to Germany, which introduced DST in 1916 for the first time.
#
# The tzdata rules for Switzerland must be changed to:
# Rule  Swiss   1941    1942    -       May     Mon>=1  1:00    1:00    S
# Rule  Swiss   1941    1942    -       Oct     Mon>=1  2:00    0       -
#
# The 1940 rules must be deleted.
#
# One further detail for Switzerland, which is probably out of scope for
# most users of tzdata: The [Europe/Zurich zone] ...
# describes all of Switzerland correctly, with the exception of
# the Canton de Genève (Geneva, Genf). Between 1848 and 1894 Geneva did not
# follow Bern Mean Time but kept its own local mean time.
# To represent this, an extra zone would be needed.
#
# From Alois Treindl (2013-09-11):
# The Federal regulations say
# https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20071096/index.html
# ... the meridian for Bern mean time ... is 7° 26' 22.50".
# Expressed in time, it is 0h29m45.5s.

# From Pierre-Yves Berger (2013-09-11):
# the "Circulaire du conseil fédéral" (December 11 1893)
# http://www.amtsdruckschriften.bar.admin.ch/viewOrigDoc.do?id=10071353
# clearly states that the [1894-06-01] change should be done at midnight
# but if no one is present after 11 at night, could be postponed until one
# hour before the beginning of service.

# From Paul Eggert (2013-09-11):
# Round BMT to the nearest even second, 0:29:46.
#
# We can find no reliable source for Shanks's assertion that all of Switzerland
# except Geneva switched to Bern Mean Time at 00:00 on 1848-09-12.  This book:
#
#	Jakob Messerli. Gleichmässig, pünktlich, schnell. Zeiteinteilung und
#	Zeitgebrauch in der Schweiz im 19. Jahrhundert. Chronos, Zurich 1995,
#	ISBN 3-905311-68-2, OCLC 717570797.
#
# suggests that the transition was more gradual, and that the Swiss did not
# agree about civil time during the transition.  The timekeeping it gives the
# most detail for is postal and telegraph time: here, federal legislation (the
# "Bundesgesetz über die Erstellung von elektrischen Telegraphen") passed on
# 1851-11-23, and an official implementation notice was published 1853-07-16
# (Bundesblatt 1853, Bd. II, S. 859).  On p 72 Messerli writes that in
# practice since July 1853 Bernese time was used in "all postal and telegraph
# offices in Switzerland from Geneva to St. Gallen and Basel to Chiasso"
# (Google translation).  For now, model this transition as occurring on
# 1853-07-16, though it probably occurred at some other date in Zurich, and
# legal civil time probably changed at still some other transition date.

# From Tobias Conradi (2011-09-12):
# Büsingen <http://www.buesingen.de>, surrounded by the Swiss canton
# Schaffhausen, did not start observing DST in 1980 as the rest of DE
# (West Germany at that time) and DD (East Germany at that time) did.
# DD merged into DE, the area is currently covered by code DE in ISO 3166-1,
# which in turn is covered by the zone Europe/Berlin.

# Ukraine
#
# From Alois Treindl (2014-03-01):
# REGULATION A N O V A on March 20, 1992 N 139 ...  means that from
# 1992 on, Ukraine had DST with begin time at 02:00 am, on last Sunday
# in March, and end time 03:00 am, last Sunday in September....
# CABINET OF MINISTERS OF UKRAINE RESOLUTION on May 13, 1996 N 509
# "On the order of computation time on the territory of Ukraine" ....
# As this cabinet decision is from May 1996, it seems likely that the
# transition in March 1996, which predates it, was still at 2:00 am
# and not at 3:00 as would have been under EU rules.
# This is why I have set the change to EU rules into May 1996,
# so that the change in March is stil covered by the Ukraine rule.
# The next change in October 1996 happened under EU rules....
# TZ database holds three other zones for Ukraine.... I have not yet
# worked out the consequences for these three zones, as we (me and my
# US colleague David Cochrane) are still trying to get more
# information upon these local deviations from Kiev rules.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2022-08-27):
# For now, assume that Ukraine's zones all followed the same rules,
# except that Crimea switched to Moscow time in 1994 as described elsewhere.

# From Igor Karpov, who works for the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice,
# via Garrett Wollman (2003-01-27):
# BTW, I've found the official document on this matter. It's government
# regulations No. 509, May 13, 1996. In my poor translation it says:
# "Time in Ukraine is set to second timezone (Kiev time). Each last Sunday
# of March at 3am the time is changing to 4am and each last Sunday of
# October the time at 4am is changing to 3am"

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-09-20):
# On September 20, 2011 the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada agreed to
# abolish the transfer clock to winter time.
#
# Bill No. 8330 of MP from the Party of Regions Oleg Nadoshi got
# approval from 266 deputies.
#
# Ukraine abolishes transfer back to the winter time (in Russian)
# http://news.mail.ru/politics/6861560/
#
# The Ukrainians will no longer change the clock (in Russian)
# http://www.segodnya.ua/news/14290482.html
#
# Deputies cancelled the winter time (in Russian)
# https://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2011/09/20/6600616/
#
# From Philip Pizzey (2011-10-18):
# Today my Ukrainian colleagues have informed me that the
# Ukrainian parliament have decided that they will go to winter
# time this year after all.
#
# From Udo Schwedt (2011-10-18):
# As far as I understand, the recent change to the Ukrainian time zone
# (Europe/Kiev) to introduce permanent daylight saving time (similar
# to Russia) was reverted today:
# http://portal.rada.gov.ua/rada/control/en/publish/article/info_left?art_id=287324&cat_id=105995

# The law documents themselves are at
# http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb_n/webproc4_1?id=&pf3511=41484

# From Vladimir in Moscow via Alois Treindl re Kyiv time 1991/2 (2014-02-28):
# First in Ukraine they changed Time zone from UTC+3 to UTC+2 with DST:
#       03 25 1990 02:00 -03.00 1       Time Zone 3 with DST
#       07 01 1990 02:00 -02.00 1       Time Zone 2 with DST
# * Ukrainian Government's Resolution of 18.06.1990, No. 134.
# http://search.ligazakon.ua/l_doc2.nsf/link1/T001500.html
#
# They did not end DST in September, 1990 (according to the law,
# "summer time" was still in action):
#       09 30 1990 03:00 -02.00 1       Time Zone 2 with DST
# * Ukrainian Government's Resolution of 21.09.1990, No. 272.
# http://search.ligazakon.ua/l_doc2.nsf/link1/KP900272.html
#
# Again no change in March, 1991 ("summer time" in action):
#       03 31 1991 02:00 -02.00 1       Time Zone 2 with DST
#
# DST ended in September 1991 ("summer time" ended):
#       09 29 1991 03:00 -02.00 0       Time Zone 2, no DST
# * Ukrainian Government's Resolution of 25.09.1991, No. 225.
# http://www.uazakon.com/documents/date_21/pg_iwgdoc.htm
# This is an answer.
#
# Since 1992 they had normal DST procedure:
#       03 29 1992 02:00 -02.00 1       DST started
#       09 27 1992 03:00 -02.00 0       DST ended

# One source shows that Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, and Greece observe DST from
# the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in September in 1986.
# The source shows Romania changing a day later than everybody else.
#
# According to Bernard Sieloff's source, Poland is in the MET time zone but
# uses the WE DST rules.  The Western USSR uses EET+1 and ME DST rules.
# Bernard Sieloff's source claims Romania switches on the same day, but at
# 00:00 standard time (i.e., 01:00 DST).  It also claims that Turkey
# switches on the same day, but switches on at 01:00 standard time
# and off at 00:00 standard time (i.e., 01:00 DST)

# From: Tom Hofmann
# ...
#
# ...the European time rules are...standardized since 1981, when
# most European countries started DST.  Before that year, only
# a few countries (UK, France, Italy) had DST, each according
# to own national rules.  In 1981, however, DST started on
# 'Apr firstSun', and not on 'Mar lastSun' as in the following
# years...
# But also since 1981 there are some more national exceptions
# than listed in 'europe': Switzerland, for example, joined DST
# one year later, Denmark ended DST on 'Oct 1' instead of 'Sep
# lastSun' in 1981 - I don't know how they handle now.
#
# Finally, DST ist always from 'Apr 1' to 'Oct 1' in the
# Soviet Union (as far as I know).

# From: Dik T. Winter
# ...
#
# The information from Tom Hofmann is (as far as I know) not entirely correct.
# After a request from chongo at amdahl I tried to retrieve all information
# about DST in Europe.  I was able to find all from about 1969.
#
# ...standardization on DST in Europe started in about 1977 with switches on
# first Sunday in April and last Sunday in September...
# In 1981 UK joined Europe insofar that
# the starting day for both shifted to last Sunday in March.  And from 1982
# the whole of Europe used DST, with switch dates April 1 and October 1 in
# the Sov[i]et Union.  In 1985 the SU reverted to standard Europe[a]n switch
# dates...
#
# It should also be remembered that time-zones are not constants; e.g.
# Portugal switched in 1976 from MET (or CET) to WET with DST...
# Note also that though there were rules for switch dates not
# all countries abided to these dates, and many individual deviations
# occurred, though not since 1982 I believe.  Another note: it is always
# assumed that DST is 1 hour ahead of normal time, this need not be the
# case; at least in the Netherlands there have been times when DST was 2 hours
# in advance of normal time.

#	In the following text, the symbol '#' introduces
#	a comment, which continues from that symbol until
#	the end of the line. A plain comment line has a
#	whitespace character following the comment indicator.
#	There are also special comment lines defined below.
#	A special comment will always have a non-whitespace
#	character in column 2.
#
#	A blank line should be ignored.
#
#	The following table shows the corrections that must
#	be applied to compute International Atomic Time (TAI)
#	from the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) values that
#	are transmitted by almost all time services.
#
#	The first column shows an epoch as a number of seconds
#	since 1 January 1900, 00:00:00 (1900.0 is also used to
#	indicate the same epoch.) Both of these time stamp formats
#	ignore the complexities of the time scales that were
#	used before the current definition of UTC at the start
#	of 1972. (See note 3 below.)
#	The second column shows the number of seconds that
#	must be added to UTC to compute TAI for any timestamp
#	at or after that epoch. The value on each line is
#	valid from the indicated initial instant until the
#	epoch given on the next one or indefinitely into the
#	future if there is no next line.
#	(The comment on each line shows the representation of
#	the corresponding initial epoch in the usual
#	day-month-year format. The epoch always begins at
#	00:00:00 UTC on the indicated day. See Note 5 below.)
#
#	Important notes:
#
#	1. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is often referred to
#	as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The GMT time scale is no
#	longer used, and the use of GMT to designate UTC is
#	discouraged.
#
#	2. The UTC time scale is realized by many national
#	laboratories and timing centers. Each laboratory
#	identifies its realization with its name: Thus
#	UTC(NIST), UTC(USNO), etc. The differences among
#	these different realizations are typically on the
#	order of a few nanoseconds (i.e., 0.000 000 00x s)
#	and can be ignored for many purposes. These differences
#	are tabulated in Circular T, which is published monthly
#	by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures
#	(BIPM). See www.bipm.org for more information.
#
#	3. The current definition of the relationship between UTC
#	and TAI dates from 1 January 1972. A number of different
#	time scales were in use before that epoch, and it can be
#	quite difficult to compute precise timestamps and time
#	intervals in those "prehistoric" days. For more information,
#	consult:
#
#		The Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical
#		Ephemeris.
#	or
#		Terry Quinn, "The BIPM and the Accurate Measurement
#		of Time," Proc. of the IEEE, Vol. 79, pp. 894-905,
#		July, 1991. <http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/5.84965>

#
#	4. The decision to insert a leap second into UTC is currently
#	the responsibility of the International Earth Rotation and
#	Reference Systems Service. (The name was changed from the
#	International Earth Rotation Service, but the acronym IERS
#	is still used.)
#
#	Leap seconds are announced by the IERS in its Bulletin C.
#
#	See www.iers.org for more details.
#
#	Every national laboratory and timing center uses the
#	data from the BIPM and the IERS to construct UTC(lab),
#	their local realization of UTC.
#
#	Although the definition also includes the possibility
#	of dropping seconds ("negative" leap seconds), this has
#	never been done and is unlikely to be necessary in the
#	foreseeable future.
#
#	5. If your system keeps time as the number of seconds since
#	some epoch (e.g., NTP timestamps), then the algorithm for
#	assigning a UTC time stamp to an event that happens during a positive
#	leap second is not well defined. The official name of that leap
#	second is 23:59:60, but there is no way of representing that time
#	in these systems.
#	Many systems of this type effectively stop the system clock for
#	one second during the leap second and use a time that is equivalent
#	to 23:59:59 UTC twice. For these systems, the corresponding TAI
#	timestamp would be obtained by advancing to the next entry in the
#	following table when the time equivalent to 23:59:59 UTC
#	is used for the second time. Thus the leap second which
#	occurred on 30 June 1972 at 23:59:59 UTC would have TAI
#	timestamps computed as follows:
#
#	...
#	30 June 1972 23:59:59 (2287785599, first time):	TAI= UTC + 10 seconds
#	30 June 1972 23:59:60 (2287785599,second time):	TAI= UTC + 11 seconds
#	1  July 1972 00:00:00 (2287785600)		TAI= UTC + 11 seconds
#	...
#
#	If your system realizes the leap second by repeating 00:00:00 UTC twice
#	(this is possible but not usual), then the advance to the next entry
#	in the table must occur the second time that a time equivalent to
#	00:00:00 UTC is used. Thus, using the same example as above:
#
#	...
#       30 June 1972 23:59:59 (2287785599):		TAI= UTC + 10 seconds
#       30 June 1972 23:59:60 (2287785600, first time):	TAI= UTC + 10 seconds
#       1  July 1972 00:00:00 (2287785600,second time):	TAI= UTC + 11 seconds
#	...
#
#	in both cases the use of timestamps based on TAI produces a smooth
#	time scale with no discontinuity in the time interval. However,
#	although the long-term behavior of the time scale is correct in both
#	methods, the second method is technically not correct because it adds
#	the extra second to the wrong day.
#
#	This complexity would not be needed for negative leap seconds (if they
#	are ever used). The UTC time would skip 23:59:59 and advance from
#	23:59:58 to 00:00:00 in that case. The TAI offset would decrease by
#	1 second at the same instant. This is a much easier situation to deal
#	with, since the difficulty of unambiguously representing the epoch
#	during the leap second does not arise.
#
#	Some systems implement leap seconds by amortizing the leap second
#	over the last few minutes of the day. The frequency of the local
#	clock is decreased (or increased) to realize the positive (or
#	negative) leap second. This method removes the time step described
#	above. Although the long-term behavior of the time scale is correct
#	in this case, this method introduces an error during the adjustment
#	period both in time and in frequency with respect to the official
#	definition of UTC.

#
#	The NTP timestamps are in units of seconds since the NTP epoch,
#	which is 1 January 1900, 00:00:00. The Modified Julian Day number
#	corresponding to the NTP time stamp, X, can be computed as
#
#	X/86400 + 15020
#
#	where the first term converts seconds to days and the second
#	term adds the MJD corresponding to the time origin defined above.
#	The integer portion of the result is the integer MJD for that
#	day, and any remainder is the time of day, expressed as the
#	fraction of the day since 0 hours UTC. The conversion from day
#	fraction to seconds or to hours, minutes, and seconds may involve
#	rounding or truncation, depending on the method used in the
#	computation.
#
#	The data in this file will be updated periodically as new leap
#	seconds are announced. In addition to being entered on the line
#	above, the update time (in NTP format) will be added to the basic
#	file name leap-seconds to form the name leap-seconds.<NTP TIME>.
#	In addition, the generic name leap-seconds.list will always point to
#	the most recent version of the file.
#
#	This update procedure will be performed only when a new leap second
#	is announced.
#
#	The following entry specifies the expiration date of the data
#	in this file in units of seconds since the origin at the instant
#	1 January 1900, 00:00:00. This expiration date will be changed
#	at least twice per year whether or not a new leap second is
#	announced. These semi-annual changes will be made no later
#	than 1 June and 1 December of each year to indicate what
#	action (if any) is to be taken on 30 June and 31 December,
#	respectively. (These are the customary effective dates for new
#	leap seconds.) This expiration date will be identified by a
#	unique pair of characters in columns 1 and 2 as shown below.
#	In the unlikely event that a leap second is announced with an
#	effective date other than 30 June or 31 December, then this
#	file will be edited to include that leap second as soon as it is
#	announced or at least one month before the effective date
#	(whichever is later).
#	If an announcement by the IERS specifies that no leap second is
#	scheduled, then only the expiration date of the file will
#	be advanced to show that the information in the file is still
#	current -- the update time stamp, the data and the name of the file
#	will not change.

# POSIX will almost surely require at least 2**53 for awk, so for NTP
# timestamps this program should be good until the year 285,428,681

###############################################################################

# United States

# From Paul Eggert (1999-03-31):
# Howse writes (pp 121-125) that time zones were invented by
# Professor Charles Ferdinand Dowd (1825-1904),
# Principal of Temple Grove Ladies' Seminary (Saratoga Springs, NY).
# His pamphlet "A System of National Time for Railroads" (1870)
# was the result of his proposals at the Convention of Railroad Trunk Lines
# in New York City (1869-10).  His 1870 proposal was based on Washington, DC,
# but in 1872-05 he moved the proposed origin to Greenwich.

# From Paul Eggert (2018-03-20):
# Dowd's proposal left many details unresolved, such as where to draw
# lines between time zones.  The key individual who made time zones
# work in the US was William Frederick Allen - railway engineer,
# managing editor of the Travelers' Guide, and secretary of the
# General Time Convention, a railway standardization group.  Allen
# spent months in dialogs with scientific and railway leaders,
# developed a workable plan to institute time zones, and presented it
# to the General Time Convention on 1883-04-11, saying that his plan
# meant "local time would be practically abolished" - a plus for
# railway scheduling.  By the next convention on 1883-10-11 nearly all
# railroads had agreed and it took effect on 1883-11-18.  That Sunday
# was called the "day of two noons", as some locations observed noon
# twice.  Allen witnessed the transition in New York City, writing:
#
#   I heard the bells of St. Paul's strike on the old time.  Four
#   minutes later, obedient to the electrical signal from the Naval
#   Observatory ... the time-ball made its rapid descent, the chimes
#   of old Trinity rang twelve measured strokes, and local time was
#   abandoned, probably forever.
#
# Most of the US soon followed suit.  See:
# Bartky IR. The adoption of standard time. Technol Cult 1989 Jan;30(1):25-56.
# https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3105430

# From Paul Eggert (2005-04-16):
# That 1883 transition occurred at 12:00 new time, not at 12:00 old time.
# See p 46 of David Prerau, Seize the daylight, Thunder's Mouth Press (2005).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# A good source for time zone historical data in the US is
# Thomas G. Shanks, The American Atlas (5th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1991).
# Make sure you have the errata sheet; the book is somewhat useless without it.
# It is the source for most of the pre-1991 US entries below.

# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
# Daylight Saving Time was first suggested as a joke by Benjamin Franklin
# in his whimsical essay "An Economical Project for Diminishing the Cost
# of Light" published in the Journal de Paris (1784-04-26).
# Not everyone is happy with the results:
#
#	I don't really care how time is reckoned so long as there is some
#	agreement about it, but I object to being told that I am saving

# Shanks says that DST was called "War Time" in the US in 1918 and 1919.
# However, DST was imposed by the Standard Time Act of 1918, which
# was the first nationwide legal time standard, and apparently
# time was just called "Standard Time" or "Daylight Saving Time".

# From Paul Eggert (2019-06-04):
# Here is the legal basis for the US federal rules.
# * Public Law 65-106 (1918-03-19) implemented standard and daylight saving
#   time for the first time across the US, springing forward on March's last
#   Sunday and falling back on October's last Sunday.
#   https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/65th-congress/session-2/c65s2ch24.pdf
# * Public Law 66-40 (1919-08-20) repealed DST on October 1919's last Sunday.
#   https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/66th-congress/session-1/c66s1ch51.pdf
# * Public Law 77-403 (1942-01-20) started wartime DST on 1942-02-09.
#   https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/77th-congress/session-2/c77s2ch7.pdf
# * Public Law 79-187 (1945-09-25) ended wartime DST on 1945-09-30.
#   https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/79th-congress/session-1/c79s1ch388.pdf
# * Public Law 89-387 (1966-04-13) reinstituted a national standard for DST,
#   from April's last Sunday to October's last Sunday, effective 1967.
#   https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-80/pdf/STATUTE-80-Pg107.pdf

# All transitions are at 02:00 local time.

# From Arthur David Olson:
# Before the Uniform Time Act of 1966 took effect in 1967, observance of
# Daylight Saving Time in the US was by local option, except during wartime.

# From Arthur David Olson (2000-09-25):
# Last night I heard part of a rebroadcast of a 1945 Arch Oboler radio drama.
# In the introduction, Oboler spoke of "Eastern Peace Time."
# An AltaVista search turned up:
# https://web.archive.org/web/20000926032210/http://rowayton.org/rhs/hstaug45.html
# "When the time is announced over the radio now, it is 'Eastern Peace
# Time' instead of the old familiar 'Eastern War Time.'  Peace is wonderful."
# (August 1945) by way of confirmation.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-09-23):
# This was the V-J Day issue of the Clamdigger, a Rowayton, CT newsletter.

# From Joseph Gallant citing
# George H. Douglas, _The Early Days of Radio Broadcasting_ (1987):
# At 7 P.M. (Eastern War Time) [on 1945-08-14], the networks were set
# to switch to London for Attlee's address, but the American people
# never got to hear his speech live. According to one press account,
# CBS' Bob Trout was first to announce the word of Japan's surrender,
# but a few seconds later, NBC, ABC and Mutual also flashed the word
# of surrender, all of whom interrupting the bells of Big Ben in
# London which were to precede Mr. Attlee's speech.

# From Paul Eggert (2003-02-09): It was Robert St John, not Bob Trout.  From
# Myrna Oliver's obituary of St John on page B16 of today's Los Angeles Times:
#
# ... a war-weary U.S. clung to radios, awaiting word of Japan's surrender.
# Any announcement from Asia would reach St. John's New York newsroom on a
# wire service teletype machine, which had prescribed signals for major news.
# Associated Press, for example, would ring five bells before spewing out
# typed copy of an important story, and 10 bells for news "of transcendental
# importance."
#
# On Aug. 14, stalling while talking steadily into the NBC networks' open
# microphone, St. John heard five bells and waited only to hear a sixth bell,
# before announcing confidently: "Ladies and gentlemen, World War II is over.
# The Japanese have agreed to our surrender terms."
#
# He had scored a 20-second scoop on other broadcasters.

# From Arthur David Olson (2005-08-22):
# Paul has been careful to use the "US" rules only in those locations
# that are part of the United States; this reflects the real scope of
# U.S. government action.  So even though the "US" rules have changed
# in the latest release, other countries won't be affected.

# From Dave Cantor (2004-11-02):
# Early this summer I had the occasion to visit the Mount Washington
# Observatory weather station atop (of course!) Mount Washington [, NH]....
# One of the staff members said that the station was on Eastern Standard Time
# and didn't change their clocks for Daylight Saving ... so that their
# reports will always have times which are 5 hours behind UTC.

# From Paul Eggert (2005-08-26):
# According to today's Huntsville Times
# http://www.al.com/news/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?/base/news/1125047783228320.xml&coll=1
# a few towns on Alabama's "eastern border with Georgia, such as Phenix City

# in Columbus."
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-02-22):
# Four cities are involved.  The two not mentioned above are Smiths Station
# and Valley.  Barbara Brooks, Valley's assistant treasurer, heard it started

# From Paul Eggert (2018-01-07):
# In 1869 the Chicago Astronomical Society contracted with the city to keep
# time.  Though delayed by the Great Fire, by 1880 a wire ran from the
# Dearborn Observatory (on the University of Chicago campus) to City Hall,
# which then sent signals to police and fire stations.  However, railroads got
# their time signals from the Allegheny Observatory, the Madison Observatory,
# the Ann Arbor Observatory, etc., so their clocks did not agree with each
# other or with the city's official time.  The confusion took some years to
# clear up.  See:

# From an email administrator of the City of Fort Pierre, SD (2015-12-21):
# Fort Pierre is technically located in the Mountain time zone as is
# the rest of Stanley County.  Most of Stanley County and Fort Pierre
# uses the Central time zone due to doing most of their business in
# Pierre so it simplifies schedules.  I have lived in Stanley County
# all my life and it has been that way since I can remember.  (43 years!)
#
# From Paul Eggert (2015-12-25):
# Assume this practice predates 1970, so Fort Pierre can use America/Chicago.

# From Paul Eggert (2015-04-06):
# In 1950s Nashville a public clock had dueling faces, one for conservatives
# and the other for liberals; the two sides didn't agree about the time of day.
# I haven't found a photo of this clock, nor have I tracked down the TIME
# magazine report cited below, but here's the story as told by the late
# American journalist John Seigenthaler, who was there:
#
# "The two [newspaper] owners held strongly contrasting political and
# ideological views.  Evans was a New South liberal, Stahlman an Old South
# conservative, and their two papers frequently clashed editorially, often on
# the same day....  In the 1950s as the state legislature was grappling with
# the question of whether to approve daylight saving time for the entire state,
# TIME magazine reported:
#
# "'The Nashville Banner and The Nashville Tennessean rarely agree on anything
# but the time of day - and last week they couldn't agree on that.'
#
# "It was all too true. The clock on the front of the building had two faces -
# The Tennessean side of the building facing west, the other, east.  When it
# was high noon Banner time, it was 11 a.m. Tennessean time."
#
# Seigenthaler J. For 100 years, Tennessean had it covered.

#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-10-25):
# On 1921-03-04 federal law placed all of Texas into the central time zone.
# However, El Paso ignored the law for decades and continued to observe
# mountain time, on the grounds that that's what they had always done
# and they weren't about to let the federal government tell them what to do.
# Eventually the federal government gave in and changed the law on
# 1970-04-10 to match what El Paso was actually doing.  Although
# that's slightly after our 1970 cutoff, there is no need to create a

# From Paul Eggert (2016-08-20):
# In early February 1948, in response to California's electricity shortage,
# PG&E changed power frequency from 60 to 59.5 Hz during daylight hours,
# causing electric clocks to lose six minutes per day.  (This did not change
# legal time, and is not part of the data here.)  See:
# Ross SA. An energy crisis from the past: Northern California in 1948.
# Working Paper No. 8, Institute of Governmental Studies, UC Berkeley,
# 1973-11.  https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8x22k30c
#
# In another measure to save electricity, DST was instituted from 1948-03-14
# at 02:01 to 1949-01-16 at 02:00, with the governor having the option to move
# the fallback transition earlier.  See pages 3-4 of:
# http://clerk.assembly.ca.gov/sites/clerk.assembly.ca.gov/files/archive/Statutes/1948/48Vol1_Chapters.pdf
#
# In response:
#
#   Governor Warren received a torrent of objecting mail, and it is not too much
#   to speculate that the objections to Daylight Saving Time were one important
#   factor in the defeat of the Dewey-Warren Presidential ticket in California.
#     -- Ross, p 25
#
# On December 8 the governor exercised the option, setting the date to January 1
# (LA Times 1948-12-09).  The transition time was 02:00 (LA Times 1949-01-01).
#
# Despite the controversy, in 1949 California voters approved Proposition 12,
# which established DST from April's last Sunday at 01:00 until September's
# last Sunday at 02:00. This was amended by 1962's Proposition 6, which changed
# the fall-back date to October's last Sunday. See:

# Alaska
# AK%sT is the modern abbreviation for -09 per USNO.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-06-15):
# Howse writes that Alaska switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar,
# and from east-of-GMT to west-of-GMT days, when the US bought it from Russia.
# On Friday, 1867-10-18 (Gregorian), at precisely 15:30 local time, the
# Russian forts and fleet at Sitka fired salutes to mark the ceremony of
# formal transfer.  See the Sacramento Daily Union (1867-11-14), p 3, col 2.
# https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SDU18671114.2.12.1
# Sitka workers did not change their calendars until Sunday, 1867-10-20,
# and so celebrated two Sundays that week.  See: Ahllund T (tr Hallamaa P).
# From the memoirs of a Finnish workman. Alaska History. 2006 Fall;21(2):1-25.
# http://alaskahistoricalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ahllund-2006-Memoirs-of-a-Finnish-Workman.pdf
# Include only the time zone part of this transition, ignoring the switch
# from Julian to Gregorian, since we can't represent the Julian calendar.
#
# As far as we know, of the locations mentioned below only Sitka was
# permanently inhabited in 1867 by anyone using either calendar.
# (Yakutat was colonized by the Russians in 1799, but the settlement was
# destroyed in 1805 by a Yakutat-kon war party.)  Many of Alaska's inhabitants
# were unaware of the US acquisition of Alaska, much less of any calendar or
# time change.  However, the Russian-influenced part of Alaska did observe
# Russian time, and it is more accurate to model this than to ignore it.
# The database format requires an exact transition time; use the Russian
# salute as a somewhat-arbitrary time for the formal transfer of control for
# all of Alaska.  Sitka's UTC offset is -9:01:13; adjust its 15:30 to the
# local times of other Alaskan locations so that they change simultaneously.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-18):
# One opinion of the early 1980s turmoil in Alaska over time zones and
# daylight saving time appeared as graffiti on a Juneau airport wall:
# "Welcome to Juneau.  Please turn your watch back to the 19th century."
# See: Turner W. Alaska's four time zones now two. NY Times 1983-11-01.

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-02-01):
# Here's database-relevant material from the 2001 "Alaska History" article:
#
# On September 20 [1979]...DOT...officials decreed that on April 27,
# 1980, Juneau and other nearby communities would move to Yukon Time.
# Sitka, Petersburg, Wrangell, and Ketchikan, however, would remain on
# Pacific Time.
#
# ...on September 22, 1980, DOT Secretary Neil E. Goldschmidt rescinded the
# Department's September 1979 decision. Juneau and other communities in
# northern Southeast reverted to Pacific Time on October 26.
#
# On October 28 [1983]...the Metlakatla Indian Community Council voted
# unanimously to keep the reservation on Pacific Time.
#
# According to DOT official Joanne Petrie, Indian reservations are not
# bound to follow time zones imposed by neighboring jurisdictions.
#
# (The last is consistent with how the database now handles the Navajo
# Nation.)

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-02-09):
# I just spoke by phone with a staff member at the Metlakatla Indian
# Community office (using contact information available at
# http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/commdb/CIS.cfm?Comm_Boro_name=Metlakatla
# It's shortly after 1:00 here on the east coast of the United States;
# the staffer said it was shortly after 10:00 there. When I asked whether
# that meant they were on Pacific time, they said no - they were on their
# own time. I asked about daylight saving; they said it wasn't used. I
# did not inquire about practices in the past.

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-08-17):
# For lack of better information, assume that Metlakatla's
# abandonment of use of daylight saving resulted from the 1983 vote.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2015-11-09):
# It seems Metlakatla did go off PST on Sunday, November 1, changing
# their time to AKST and are going to follow Alaska's DST, switching
# between AKST and AKDT from now on....
# https://www.krbd.org/2015/10/30/annette-island-times-they-are-a-changing/

# From Ryan Stanley (2018-11-06):
# The Metlakatla community in Alaska has decided not to change its
# clock back an hour starting on November 4th, 2018 (day before yesterday).
# They will be gmtoff=-28800 year-round.

# From Paul Eggert (2018-12-16):
# In a 2018-12-11 special election, Metlakatla voted to go back to
# Alaska time (including daylight saving time) starting next year.
# https://www.krbd.org/2018/12/12/metlakatla-to-follow-alaska-standard-time-allow-liquor-sales/
#
# From Ryan Stanley (2019-01-11):
# The community will be changing back on the 20th of this month...
# From Tim Parenti (2019-01-11):
# Per an announcement on the Metlakatla community's official Facebook page, the
# "fall back" will be on Sunday 2019-01-20 at 02:00:
# https://www.facebook.com/141055983004923/photos/607150969728753/
# So they won't be waiting for Alaska to join them on 2019-03-10, but will
# rather change their clocks twice in seven weeks.

# the article is available at
# https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/239/2/JL26215.pdf
# and indicates that standard time was adopted effective noon, January
# 13, 1896 (page 218), that in "1933, the Legislature decreed daylight
# saving for the period between the last Sunday of each April and the
# last Sunday of each September, but less than a month later repealed the

# <http://www.dlapr.lib.az.us/links/daylight.htm> (2002-01-23)
# maintained by the Arizona State Library, Archives and Public Records.
# Between 1944-01-01 and 1944-04-01 the State of Arizona used standard
# time, but by federal law railroads, airlines, bus lines, military
# personnel, and some engaged in interstate commerce continued to
# observe war (i.e., daylight saving) time.  The 1944-03-17 Phoenix
# Gazette says that was the date the law changed, and that 04-01 was
# the date the state's clocks would change.  In 1945 the State of
# Arizona used standard time all year, again with exceptions only as
# mandated by federal law.  Arizona observed DST in 1967, but Arizona
# Laws 1968, ch. 183 (effective 1968-03-21) repealed DST.

# Indiana
#
# For a map of Indiana's time zone regions, see:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Indiana
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-11-30):
# A brief but entertaining history of time in Indiana describes a 1949 debate
# in the Indiana House where city legislators (who favored "fast time")
# tussled with farm legislators (who didn't) over a bill to outlaw DST:
#  "Lacking enough votes, the city faction tries to filibuster until time runs
#   out on the session at midnight, but rural champion Rep. Herbert Copeland,
#   R-Madison, leans over the gallery railing and forces the official clock
#   back to 9 p.m., breaking it in the process.  The clock sticks on 9 as the
#   debate rages on into the night.  The filibuster finally dies out and the
#   bill passes, while outside the chamber, clocks read 3:30 a.m.  In the end,
#   it doesn't matter which side won.  The law has no enforcement powers and
#   is simply ignored by fast-time communities."

#
# From Paul Eggert (2007-08-17):
# Since 1970, most of Indiana has been like America/Indiana/Indianapolis,
# with the following exceptions:
#
# - Gibson, Jasper, Lake, LaPorte, Newton, Porter, Posey, Spencer,
#   Vanderburgh, and Warrick counties have been like America/Chicago.
#
# - Dearborn and Ohio counties have been like America/New_York.
#
# - Clark, Floyd, and Harrison counties have been like
#   America/Kentucky/Louisville.
#
# - Crawford, Daviess, Dubois, Knox, Martin, Perry, Pike, Pulaski, Starke,
#   and Switzerland counties have their own time zone histories as noted below.
#
# Shanks partitioned Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
# and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."
# Those Hoosiers!  Such a flighty and changeable people!
# Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
#
# Other than Indianapolis, the Indiana place names are so nondescript
# that they would be ambiguous if we left them at the 'America' level.
# So we reluctantly put them all in a subdirectory 'America/Indiana'.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-26):
# https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2006/01/20/06-563/standard-time-zone-boundary-in-the-state-of-indiana
# says "DOT is relocating the time zone boundary in Indiana to move Starke,

# From Paul Eggert (2018-03-20):
# The Louisville & Nashville Railroad's 1883-11-18 change occurred at
# 10:00 old local time; train were supposed to come to a standstill
# for precisely 18 minutes.  See Bartky Fig. 1 (page 50).  It is not
# clear how this matched civil time in Louisville, so for now continue
# to assume Louisville switched at noon new local time, like New York.
#
# From Michael Deckers (2019-08-06):
# From the contemporary source given by Alois Treindl,
# the switch in Louisville on 1946-04-28 was on 00:01
# From Paul Eggert (2019-08-26):
# That source was the Louisville Courier-Journal, 1946-04-27, p 4.
# Shanks gives 02:00 for all 20th-century transition times in Louisville.
# Evidently this is wrong for spring 1946.  Although also likely wrong
# for other dates, we have no data.
#
# Part of Kentucky left its clocks alone in 1974.

# Wayne County, Kentucky
#
# From Lake Cumberland LIFE
# http://www.lake-cumberland.com/life/archive/news990129time.shtml
# (1999-01-29) via WKYM-101.7:
# Clinton County has joined Wayne County in asking the DoT to change from
# the Central to the Eastern time zone....  The Wayne County government made
# the same request in December.  And while Russell County officials have not
# taken action, the majority of respondents to a poll conducted there in
# August indicated they would like to change to "fast time" also.
# The three Lake Cumberland counties are the farthest east of any U.S.
# location in the Central time zone.
#
# From Rich Wales (2000-08-29):
# After prolonged debate, and despite continuing deep differences of opinion,
# Wayne County (central Kentucky) is switching from Central (-0600) to Eastern
# (-0500) time.  They won't "fall back" this year.  See Sara Shipley,
# The difference an hour makes, Nando Times (2000-08-29 15:33 -0400).
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-07-16):
# The final rule was published in the
# Federal Register 65, 160 (2000-08-17), pp 50154-50158.

# From Rives McDow (2000-08-30):
# Here ... are all the changes in the US since 1985.
# Kearny County, KS (put all of county on central;
#	previously split between MST and CST) ... 1990-10
# Starke County, IN (from CST to EST) ... 1991-10
# Oliver County, ND (from MST to CST) ... 1992-10
# West Wendover, NV (from PST TO MST) ... 1999-10
# Wayne County, KY (from CST to EST) ... 2000-10
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-07-17):
# We don't know where the line used to be within Kearny County, KS,
# so omit that change for now.
# See America/Indiana/Knox for the Starke County, IN change.
# See America/North_Dakota/Center for the Oliver County, ND change.
# West Wendover, NV officially switched from Pacific to mountain time on
# 1999-10-31.  See the
# Federal Register 64, 203 (1999-10-21), pp 56705-56707.
# https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1999-10-21/html/99-27240.htm
# However, the Federal Register says that West Wendover already operated
# on mountain time, and the rule merely made this official;
# hence a separate tz entry is not needed.

# Michigan
#
# From Bob Devine (1988-01-28):
# Michigan didn't observe DST from 1968 to 1973.
#
# From Paul Eggert (1999-03-31):
# Shanks writes that Michigan started using standard time on 1885-09-18,
# but Howse writes (pp 124-125, referring to Popular Astronomy, 1901-01)
# that Detroit kept
#
#	local time until 1900 when the City Council decreed that clocks should
#	be put back twenty-eight minutes to Central Standard Time.  Half the
#	city obeyed, half refused.  After considerable debate, the decision
#	was rescinded and the city reverted to Sun time.  A derisive offer to
#	erect a sundial in front of the city hall was referred to the
#	Committee on Sewers.  Then, in 1905, Central time was adopted
#	by city vote.
#
# This story is too entertaining to be false, so go with Howse over Shanks.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
# Garland (1927) writes "Cleveland and Detroit advanced their clocks
# one hour in 1914."  This change is not in Shanks.  We have no more
# info, so omit this for now.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2019-07-06):
# Due to a complicated set of legal maneuvers, in 1967 Michigan did
# not start daylight saving time when the rest of the US did.
# Instead, it began DST on Jun 14 at 00:01.  This was big news:
# the Detroit Free Press reported it at the top of Page 1 on
# 1967-06-14, in an article "State Adjusting to Switch to Fast Time"
# by Gary Blonston, above an article about Thurgood Marshall's
# confirmation to the US Supreme Court.  Although Shanks says Detroit
# observed DST until 1967-10-29 00:01, that time of day seems to be
# incorrect, as the Free Press later said DST ended in Michigan at the
# same time as the rest of the US.  Also, although Shanks reports no DST in
# Detroit in 1968, it did observe DST that year; in the November 1968
# election Michigan voters narrowly repealed DST, effective 1969.
#
# Most of Michigan observed DST from 1973 on, but was a bit late in 1975.

# H. David Matthews and Mary Vincent's map
# "It's about TIME", _Canadian Geographic_ (September-October 1998)
# http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/SO98/alacarte.asp
# contains detailed boundaries for regions observing nonstandard
# time and daylight saving time arrangements in Canada circa 1998.
#
# National Research Council Canada maintains info about time zones and DST.
# https://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/services/time/time_zones.html
# https://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/services/time/faq/index.html#Q5
# Its unofficial information is often taken from Matthews and Vincent.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-06-27):
# For now, assume all of DST-observing Canada will fall into line with the
# new US DST rules,

# From Chris Walton (2011-12-01)
# In the first of Tammy Hardwick's articles
# http://www.ilovecreston.com/?p=articles&t=spec&ar=260
# she quotes the Friday November 1/1918 edition of the Creston Review.
# The quote includes these two statements:
# 'Sunday the CPR went back to the old system of time...'
# '... The daylight saving scheme was dropped all over Canada at the same time,'
# These statements refer to a transition from daylight time to standard time
# that occurred nationally on Sunday October 27/1918.  This transition was
# also documented in the Saturday October 26/1918 edition of the Toronto Star.

# In light of that evidence, we alter the date from the earlier believed
# Oct 31, to Oct 27, 1918 (and Sunday is a more likely transition day
# than Thursday) in all Canadian rulesets.

# west Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward I,
# Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Listuguj reserve

# From Brian Inglis (2015-07-20):
# From the historical weather station records available at:
# https://weatherspark.com/history/28351/1971/Sydney-Nova-Scotia-Canada
# Sydney shares the same time history as Glace Bay, so was
# likely to be the same across the island....
# Sydney, as the capital and most populous location, or Cape Breton, would
# have been better names for the zone had we known this in 1996.

# From Paul Eggert (2015-07-20):
# Shanks & Pottenger write that since 1970 most of this region has been like
# Halifax.  Many locales did not observe peacetime DST until 1972;
# the Cape Breton area, represented by Glace Bay, is the largest we know of
# (Glace Bay was perhaps not the best name choice but no point changing now).
# Shanks & Pottenger also write that Liverpool, NS was the only town
# in Canada to observe DST in 1971 but not 1970; for now we'll assume
# this is a typo.

# From Jeffery Nichols (2020-01-09):
# America/Halifax ... also applies to Îles-de-la-Madeleine and the Listuguj
# reserve in Quebec. Officially, this came into effect on January 1, 2007
# (Legal Time Act, CQLR c T-5.1), but the legislative debates surrounding that
# bill say that it is "accommodating the customs and practices" of those
# regions, which suggests that they have always been in-line with Halifax.

# Quebec

# From Paul Eggert (2020-01-10):
# See America/Toronto for most of Quebec, including Montreal.
# See America/Halifax for the Îles de la Madeleine and the Listuguj reserve.
# See America/Puerto_Rico for east of Natashquan.

# Ontario

# From Mark Brader (2003-07-26):
# [According to the Toronto Star] Orillia, Ontario, adopted DST
# effective Saturday, 1912-06-22, 22:00; the article mentions that
# Port Arthur (now part of Thunder Bay, Ontario) as well as Moose Jaw
# have already done so.  In Orillia DST was to run until Saturday,
# 1912-08-31 (no time mentioned), but it was met with considerable
# hostility from certain segments of the public, and was revoked after
# only two weeks - I copied it as Saturday, 1912-07-07, 22:00, but
# presumably that should be -07-06.  (1912-06-19, -07-12; also letters
# earlier in June).
#
# Kenora, Ontario, was to abandon DST on 1914-06-01 (-05-21).
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-07-08):
# For more on Orillia, see: Daubs K. Bold attempt at daylight saving
# time became a comic failure in Orillia. Toronto Star 2017-07-08.
# https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2017/07/08/bold-attempt-at-daylight-saving-time-became-a-comic-failure-in-orillia.html

# From Mark Brader (2010-03-06):
#
# In the (Toronto) Globe and Mail for Saturday, 1955-09-24, in the bottom
# right corner of page 1, it says that Toronto will return to standard
# time at 2 am Sunday morning (which agrees with the database), and that:
#
#     The one-hour setback will go into effect throughout most of Ontario,
#     except in areas like Windsor which remains on standard time all year.
#
# ... I don't know if Windsor began observing DST when Detroit did,
# or in 1974, or on some other date.
#
# By the way, the article continues by noting that:
#
#     Some cities in the United States have pushed the deadline back
#     three weeks and will change over from daylight saving in October.

# From Arthur David Olson (2010-07-17):
#
# "Standard Time and Time Zones in Canada" appeared in
# The Journal of The Royal Astronomical Society of Canada,
# volume 26, number 2 (February 1932) and, as of 2010-07-17,
# was available at
# http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1932JRASC..26...49S
#
# It includes the text below (starting on page 57):
#
#   A list of the places in Canada using daylight saving time would
# require yearly revision. From information kindly furnished by
# the provincial governments and by the postmasters in many cities
# and towns, it is found that the following places used daylight sav-
# ing in 1930. The information for the province of Quebec is definite,
# for the other provinces only approximate:
#
#	Province	Daylight saving time used
# Prince Edward Island	Not used.
# Nova Scotia		In Halifax only.
# New Brunswick		In St. John only.
# Quebec		In the following places:
#			Montreal	Lachine
#			Quebec		Mont-Royal
#			Lévis		Iberville
#			St. Lambert	Cap de la Madelèine
#			Verdun		Loretteville
#			Westmount	Richmond
#			Outremont	St. Jérôme
#			Longueuil	Greenfield Park
#			Arvida		Waterloo
#			Chambly-Canton	Beaulieu
#			Melbourne	La Tuque
#			St. Théophile	Buckingham
# Ontario		Used generally in the cities and towns along
#			the southerly part of the province. Not
#			used in the northwesterly part.
# Manitoba		Not used.
# Saskatchewan		In Regina only.
# Alberta		Not used.
# British Columbia	Not used.
#
#   With some exceptions, the use of daylight saving may be said to be limited
# to those cities and towns lying between Quebec city and Windsor, Ont.

# Manitoba

# From Rob Douglas (2006-04-06):
# the old Manitoba Time Act - as amended by Bill 2, assented to
# March 27, 1987 ... said ...
# "between two o'clock Central Standard Time in the morning of
# the first Sunday of April of each year and two o'clock Central
# Standard Time in the morning of the last Sunday of October next
# following, one hour in advance of Central Standard Time."...
# I believe that the English legislation [of the old time act] had
# been assented to (March 22, 1967)....
# Also, as far as I can tell, there was no order-in-council varying
# the time of Daylight Saving Time for 2005 and so the provisions of
# the 1987 version would apply - the changeover was at 2:00 Central
# Standard Time (i.e. not until 3:00 Central Daylight Time).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-04-10):
# Shanks & Pottenger say Manitoba switched at 02:00 (not 02:00s)
# starting 1966.  Since 02:00s is clearly correct for 1967 on, assume
# it was also 02:00s in 1966.

# Saskatchewan

# From Mark Brader (2003-07-26):
# The first actual adoption of DST in Canada was at the municipal
# level.  As the [Toronto] Star put it (1912-06-07), "While people
# elsewhere have long been talking of legislation to save daylight,
# the city of Moose Jaw [Saskatchewan] has acted on its own hook."
# DST in Moose Jaw began on Saturday, 1912-06-01 (no time mentioned:
# presumably late evening, as below), and would run until "the end of
# the summer".  The discrepancy between municipal time and railroad
# time was noted.

# From Paul Eggert (2003-07-27):
# Willett (1914-03) notes that DST "has been in operation ... in the
# City of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, for one year."

# From Paul Eggert (2019-07-25):
# Pearce's book says Regina observed DST in 1914-1917.  No dates and times,
# unfortunately.  It also says that in 1914 Saskatoon observed DST
# from 1 June to 6 July, and that DST was also tried out in Davidson,
# Melfort, and Prince Albert.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Shanks & Pottenger say that since 1970 this region has mostly been as Regina.
# Some western towns (e.g. Swift Current) switched from MST/MDT to CST in 1972.
# Other western towns (e.g. Lloydminster) are like Edmonton.
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Denare Beach and Creighton
# are like Winnipeg, in violation of Saskatchewan law.

# From W. Jones (1992-11-06):
# The. . .below is based on information I got from our law library, the
# provincial archives, and the provincial Community Services department.
# A precise history would require digging through newspaper archives, and
# since you didn't say what you wanted, I didn't bother.
#
# Saskatchewan is split by a time zone meridian (105W) and over the years
# the boundary became pretty ragged as communities near it reevaluated
# their affiliations in one direction or the other.  In 1965 a provincial
# referendum favoured legislating common time practices.
#
# On 15 April 1966 the Time Act (c. T-14, Revised Statutes of
# Saskatchewan 1978) was proclaimed, and established that the eastern
# part of Saskatchewan would use CST year round, that districts in
# northwest Saskatchewan would by default follow CST but could opt to
# follow Mountain Time rules (thus 1 hour difference in the winter and
# zero in the summer), and that districts in southwest Saskatchewan would
# by default follow MT but could opt to follow CST.
#
# It took a few years for the dust to settle (I know one story of a town
# on one time zone having its school in another, such that a mom had to
# serve her family lunch in two shifts), but presently it seems that only
# a few towns on the border with Alberta (e.g. Lloydminster) follow MT
# rules any more; all other districts appear to have used CST year round
# since sometime in the 1960s.

# From Chris Walton (2006-06-26):
# The Saskatchewan time act which was last updated in 1996 is about 30 pages
# long and rather painful to read.

# Alberta

# From Alois Treindl (2019-07-19):
# There was no DST in Alberta in 1967... Calgary Herald, 29 April 1967.
# 1969, no DST, from Edmonton Journal 18 April 1969
#
# From Paul Eggert (2019-07-25):
# Pearce's book says that Alberta's 1948 Daylight Saving Act required
# Mountain Standard Time without DST, and that "anyone who broke that law
# could be fined up to $25 and costs".  There seems to be no record of
# anybody paying the fine.  The law was not changed until an August 1971
# plebiscite reinstituted DST in 1972.  This story is also mentioned in:

# British Columbia

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Shanks & Pottenger write that since 1970 most of this region has
# been like Vancouver.
# Dawson Creek uses MST.  Much of east BC is like Edmonton.

# From Matt Johnson (2015-09-21):
# Fort Nelson, BC, Canada will cancel DST this year.  So while previously they
# were aligned with America/Vancouver, they're now aligned with
# America/Dawson_Creek.
# http://www.northernrockies.ca/EN/meta/news/archives/2015/northern-rockies-time-change.html
#
# From Tim Parenti (2015-09-23):
# This requires a new zone for the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality,
# America/Fort_Nelson.  The resolution of 2014-12-08 was reached following a
# 2014-11-15 poll with nearly 75% support.  Effectively, the municipality has
# been on MST (-0700) like Dawson Creek since it advanced its clocks on
# 2015-03-08.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2019-07-25):
# Shanks says Fort Nelson did not observe DST in 1946, unlike Vancouver.
# Alois Treindl confirmed this on 07-22, citing the 1946-04-27 Vancouver Daily
# Province.  He also cited the 1946-09-28 Victoria Daily Times, which said
# that Vancouver, Victoria, etc. "change at midnight Saturday"; for now,
# guess they meant 02:00 Sunday since 02:00 was common practice in Vancouver.
#
# Early Vancouver, Volume Four, by Major J.S. Matthews, V.D., 2011 edition
# says that a 1922 plebiscite adopted DST, but a 1923 plebiscite rejected it.
# http://former.vancouver.ca/ctyclerk/archives/digitized/EarlyVan/SearchEarlyVan/Vol4pdf/MatthewsEarlyVancouverVol4_DaylightSavings.pdf

# From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) say the following, but we lack histories
# for these potential new Zones.
#
# The Canadian Forces station at Alert uses Eastern Time while the
# handful of residents at the Eureka weather station [in the Central
# zone] skip daylight savings.  Baffin Island, which is crossed by the
# Central, Eastern and Atlantic Time zones only uses Eastern Time.
# Gjoa Haven, Taloyoak and Pelly Bay all use Mountain instead of
# Central Time and Southampton Island [in the Central zone] is not
# required to use daylight savings.

# From <http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/archives/nunavut001130/nvt21110_02.html>
# Nunavut now has two time zones (2000-11-10):
# The Nunavut government would allow its employees in Kugluktuk and
# Cambridge Bay to operate on central time year-round, putting them
# one hour behind the rest of Nunavut for six months during the winter.
# At the end of October the two communities had rebelled against
# Nunavut's unified time zone, refusing to shift to eastern time with
# the rest of the territory for the winter.  Cambridge Bay remained on
# central time, while Kugluktuk, even farther west, reverted to
# mountain time, which they had used before the advent of Nunavut's
# unified time zone in 1999.
#
# From Rives McDow (2001-01-20), quoting the Nunavut government:
# The preceding decision came into effect at midnight, Saturday Nov 4, 2000.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-12-04):
# Let's just keep track of the official times for now.

# From Rives McDow (2001-03-07):
# The premier of Nunavut has issued a ministerial statement advising
# that effective 2001-04-01, the territory of Nunavut will revert
# back to three time zones (mountain, central, and eastern).  Of the
# cities in Nunavut, Coral Harbor is the only one that I know of that
# has said it will not observe dst, staying on EST year round.  I'm
# checking for more info, and will get back to you if I come up with
# more.
# [Also see <http://www.nunatsiaq.com/nunavut/nvt10309_06.html> (2001-03-09).]

# From Gwillim Law (2005-05-21):
# According to ...
# http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/SO98/geomap.asp
# (from a 1998 Canadian Geographic article), the de facto and de jure time
# for Southampton Island (at the north end of Hudson Bay) is UTC-5 all year
# round.  Using Google, it's easy to find other websites that confirm this.
# I wasn't able to find how far back this time regimen goes, but since it
# predates the creation of Nunavut, it probably goes back many years....
# The Inuktitut name of Coral Harbour is Sallit, but it's rarely used.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2014-10-17):
# For lack of better information, assume that Southampton Island observed
# daylight saving only during wartime.  Gwillim Law's email also
# mentioned maps now maintained by National Research Council Canada;
# see above for an up-to-date link.

# From Chris Walton (2007-03-01):
# ... the community of Resolute (located on Cornwallis Island in
# Nunavut) moved from Central Time to Eastern Time last November.
# Basically the community did not change its clocks at the end of
# daylight saving....
# http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2006-11/nov13_06none.html

# From Chris Walton (2011-03-21):
# Back in 2007 I initiated the creation of a new "zone file" for Resolute
# Bay. Resolute Bay is a small community located about 900km north of
# the Arctic Circle. The zone file was required because Resolute Bay had
# decided to use UTC-5 instead of UTC-6 for the winter of 2006-2007.
#
# According to new information which I received last week, Resolute Bay
# went back to using UTC-6 in the winter of 2007-2008...
#
# On March 11/2007 most of Canada went onto daylight saving. On March
# 14/2007 I phoned the Resolute Bay hamlet office to do a "time check." I
# talked to somebody that was both knowledgeable and helpful. I was able
# to confirm that Resolute Bay was still operating on UTC-5. It was
# explained to me that Resolute Bay had been on the Eastern Time zone
# (EST) in the winter, and was now back on the Central Time zone (CDT).
# i.e. the time zone had changed twice in the last year but the clocks
# had not moved. The residents had to know which time zone they were in
# so they could follow the correct TV schedule...
#
# On Nov 02/2008 most of Canada went onto standard time. On Nov 03/2008 I
# phoned the Resolute Bay hamlet office...[D]ue to the challenging nature
# of the phone call, I decided to seek out an alternate source of
# information. I found an e-mail address for somebody by the name of
# Stephanie Adams whose job was listed as "Inns North Support Officer for
# Arctic Co-operatives." I was under the impression that Stephanie lived
# and worked in Resolute Bay...
#
# On March 14/2011 I phoned the hamlet office again. I was told that
# Resolute Bay had been using Central Standard Time over the winter of
# 2010-2011 and that the clocks had therefore been moved one hour ahead
# on March 13/2011. The person I talked to was aware that Resolute Bay
# had previously experimented with Eastern Standard Time but he could not
# tell me when the practice had stopped.
#
# On March 17/2011 I searched the Web to find an e-mail address of
# somebody that might be able to tell me exactly when Resolute Bay went
# off Eastern Standard Time. I stumbled on the name "Aziz Kheraj." Aziz
# used to be the mayor of Resolute Bay and he apparently owns half the
# businesses including "South Camp Inn." This website has some info on
# Aziz:
# http://www.uphere.ca/node/493
#
# I sent Aziz an e-mail asking when Resolute Bay had stopped using
# Eastern Standard Time.
#
# Aziz responded quickly with this: "hi, The time was not changed for the
# 1 year only, the following year, the community went back to the old way
# of "spring ahead-fall behind" currently we are zulu plus 5 hrs and in
# the winter Zulu plus 6 hrs"
#
# This of course conflicted with everything I had ascertained in November 2008.
#
# I sent Aziz a copy of my 2008 e-mail exchange with Stephanie. Aziz
# responded with this: "Hi, Stephanie lives in Winnipeg. I live here, You
# may want to check with the weather office in Resolute Bay or do a
# search on the weather through Env. Canada. web site"
#
# If I had realized the Stephanie did not live in Resolute Bay I would
# never have contacted her.  I now believe that all the information I
# obtained in November 2008 should be ignored...
# I apologize for reporting incorrect information in 2008.

# From Tim Parenti (2020-03-05):
# The government of Yukon announced [yesterday] the cessation of seasonal time
# changes.  "After clocks are pushed ahead one hour on March 8, the territory
# will remain on [UTC-07].  ... [The government] found 93 per cent of
# respondents wanted to end seasonal time changes and, of that group, 70 per
# cent wanted 'permanent Pacific Daylight Saving Time.'"
# https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-end-daylight-saving-time-1.5486358
#
# Although the government press release prefers PDT, we prefer MST for
# consistency with nearby Dawson Creek, Creston, and Fort Nelson.
# https://yukon.ca/en/news/yukon-end-seasonal-time-change

# From Andrew G. Smith (2020-09-24):
# Yukon has completed its regulatory change to be on UTC -7 year-round....
# http://www.gov.yk.ca/legislation/regs/oic2020_125.pdf
# What we have done is re-defined Yukon Standard Time, as we are
# authorized to do under section 33 of our Interpretation Act:
# http://www.gov.yk.ca/legislation/acts/interpretation_c.pdf
#
# From Paul Eggert (2020-09-24):
# tzdb uses the obsolete YST abbreviation for standard time in Yukon through
# about 1970, and uses PST for standard time in Yukon since then.  Consistent
# with that, use MST for -07, the new standard time in Yukon effective Nov. 1.

# Mexico

# From Paul Eggert (2014-12-07):
# The Investigation and Analysis Service of the
# Mexican Library of Congress (MLoC) has published a
# history of Mexican local time (in Spanish)
# http://www.diputados.gob.mx/bibliot/publica/inveyana/polisoc/horver/index.htm
#
# Here are the discrepancies between Shanks & Pottenger (S&P) and the MLoC.
# (In all cases we go with the MLoC.)
# S&P report that Baja was at -8:00 in 1922/1923.
# S&P say the 1930 transition in Baja was 1930-11-16.
# S&P report no DST during summer 1931.
# S&P report a transition at 1932-03-30 23:00, not 1932-04-01.

# From Gwillim Law (2001-02-20):
# There are some other discrepancies between the Decrees page and the
# tz database.  I think they can best be explained by supposing that
# the researchers who prepared the Decrees page failed to find some of
# the relevant documents.

# From Alan Perry (1996-02-15):
# A guy from our Mexico subsidiary finally found the Presidential Decree
# outlining the timezone changes in Mexico.
#
# ------------- Begin Forwarded Message -------------
#
# I finally got my hands on the Official Presidential Decree that sets up the
# rules for the DST changes. The rules are:
#
# 1. The country is divided in 3 timezones:
#    - Baja California Norte (the Mexico/BajaNorte TZ)
#    - Baja California Sur, Nayarit, Sinaloa and Sonora (the Mexico/BajaSur TZ)
#    - The rest of the country (the Mexico/General TZ)
#
# 2. From the first Sunday in April at 2:00 AM to the last Sunday in October
#    at 2:00 AM, the times in each zone are as follows:
#    BajaNorte: GMT+7
#    BajaSur:   GMT+6
#    General:   GMT+5
#
# 3. The rest of the year, the times are as follows:
#    BajaNorte: GMT+8
#    BajaSur:   GMT+7
#    General:   GMT+6
#
# The Decree was published in Mexico's Official Newspaper on January 4th.
#
# -------------- End Forwarded Message --------------
# From Paul Eggert (1996-06-12):
# For an English translation of the decree, see
# "Diario Oficial: Time Zone Changeover" (1996-01-04).
# http://mexico-travel.com/extra/timezone_eng.html

# From Rives McDow (1998-10-08):
# The State of Quintana Roo has reverted back to central STD and DST times
# (i.e. UTC -0600 and -0500 as of 1998-08-02).

# From Rives McDow (2000-01-10):
# Effective April 4, 1999 at 2:00 AM local time, Sonora changed to the time
# zone 5 hours from the International Date Line, and will not observe daylight
# savings time so as to stay on the same time zone as the southern part of
# Arizona year round.

# From Jesper Nørgaard, translating
# <http://www.reforma.com/nacional/articulo/064327/> (2001-01-17):
# In Oaxaca, the 55.000 teachers from the Section 22 of the National
# Syndicate of Education Workers, refuse to apply daylight saving each
# year, so that the more than 10,000 schools work at normal hour the
# whole year.

# From Gwillim Law (2001-01-19):
# <http://www.reforma.com/negocios_y_dinero/articulo/064481/> ... says
# (translated):...
# January 17, 2000 - The Energy Secretary, Ernesto Martens, announced
# that Summer Time will be reduced from seven to five months, starting
# this year....
# http://www.publico.com.mx/scripts/texto3.asp?action=pagina&pag=21&pos=p&secc=naci&date=01/17/2001
# [translated], says "summer time will ... take effect on the first Sunday
# in May, and end on the last Sunday of September.

# From Arthur David Olson (2001-01-25):
# The 2001-01-24 traditional Washington Post contained the page one
# story "Timely Issue Divides Mexicans."...
# http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A37383-2001Jan23.html
# ... Mexico City Mayor López Obrador "...is threatening to keep
# Mexico City and its 20 million residents on a different time than
# the rest of the country..." In particular, López Obrador would abolish
# observation of Daylight Saving Time.

# Official statute published by the Energy Department
# http://www.conae.gob.mx/ahorro/decretohorver2001.html#decre
# (2001-02-01) shows Baja and Chihauhua as still using US DST rules,
# and Sonora with no DST.  This was reported by Jesper Nørgaard (2001-02-03).

# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-03):
#
# https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-mar-03-mn-32561-story.html
# James F. Smith writes in today's LA Times
# * Sonora will continue to observe standard time.
# * Last week Mexico City's mayor Andrés Manuel López Obrador decreed that
#   the Federal District will not adopt DST.
# * 4 of 16 district leaders announced they'll ignore the decree.
# * The decree does not affect federal-controlled facilities including
#   the airport, banks, hospitals, and schools.
#
# For now we'll assume that the Federal District will bow to federal rules.

# From Jesper Nørgaard (2001-04-01):
# I found some references to the Mexican application of daylight
# saving, which modifies what I had already sent you, stating earlier
# that a number of northern Mexican states would go on daylight
# saving. The modification reverts this to only cover Baja California
# (Norte), while all other states (except Sonora, who has no daylight
# saving all year) will follow the original decree of president
# Vicente Fox, starting daylight saving May 6, 2001 and ending
# September 30, 2001.

# From Reuters (2001-09-04):
# Mexico's Supreme Court on Tuesday declared that daylight savings was
# unconstitutional in Mexico City, creating the possibility the
# capital will be in a different time zone from the rest of the nation
# next year....  The Supreme Court's ruling takes effect at 2:00
# a.m. (0800 GMT) on Sept. 30, when Mexico is scheduled to revert to
# standard time. "This is so residents of the Federal District are not
# subject to unexpected time changes," a statement from the court said.

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2002-03-12):
# ... consulting my local grocery store(!) and my coworkers, they all insisted
# that a new decision had been made to reinstate US style DST in Mexico....
# http://www.conae.gob.mx/ahorro/horaver2001_m1_2002.html (2002-02-20)
# confirms this.  Sonora as usual is the only state where DST is not applied.

# 4- Zona Sureste (Southeast Zone): Longitude 75 W, includes the state
#    of Quintana Roo.
# 5- The islands, reefs and keys shall take their timezone from the

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Formerly there was an America/Ensenada zone, which differed from
# America/Tijuana only in that it did not observe DST from 1976
# through 1995.  This was as per Shanks (1999).  But Shanks & Pottenger say
# Ensenada did not observe DST from 1948 through 1975.  Guy Harris reports
# that the 1987 OAG says "Only Ensenada, Mexicali, San Felipe and
# Tijuana observe DST," which agrees with Shanks & Pottenger but implies that
# DST-observance was a town-by-town matter back then.  This concerns
# data after 1970 so most likely there should be at least one Zone
# other than America/Tijuana for Baja, but it's not clear yet what its
# name or contents should be.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2015-10-08):
# Formerly there was an America/Santa_Isabel zone, but this appears to
# have come from a misreading of
# http://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5127480&fecha=06/01/2010
# It has been moved to the 'backward' file.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2022-10-28):
# Today's new law states that the entire state of Baja California
# follows US DST rules, which agrees with simplifications noted above.

# From Paul Eggert (2013-02-21):
# Milne gives -5:28:50.45 for the observatory at Havana, -5:29:23.57
# for the port, and -5:30 for meteorological observations.
# For now, stick with Shanks & Pottenger.

# From Arthur David Olson (1999-03-29):
# The 1999-03-28 exhibition baseball game held in Havana, Cuba, between
# the Cuban National Team and the Baltimore Orioles was carried live on
# the Orioles Radio Network, including affiliate WTOP in Washington, DC.
# During the game, play-by-play announcer Jim Hunter noted that
# "We'll be losing two hours of sleep...Cuba switched to Daylight Saving
# Time today."  (The "two hour" remark referred to losing one hour of
# sleep on 1999-03-28 - when the announcers were in Cuba as it switched
# to DST - and one more hour on 1999-04-04 - when the announcers will have
# returned to Baltimore, which switches on that date.)

# From Steffen Thorsen (2013-11-11):
# DST start in Cuba in 2004 ... does not follow the same rules as the
# years before.  The correct date should be Sunday 2004-03-28 00:00 ...
# https://web.archive.org/web/20040402060750/http://www.granma.cu/espanol/2004/marzo/sab27/reloj.html

# From Evert van der Veer via Steffen Thorsen (2004-10-28):
# Cuba is not going back to standard time this year.
# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2004/septiembre/juev30/41medid-i.html
# says that it's due to a problem at the Antonio Guiteras
# thermoelectric plant, and says "This October there will be no return
# to normal hours (after daylight saving time)".
# For now, let's assume that it's a temporary measure.

# From Carlos A. Carnero Delgado (2005-11-12):
# This year (just like in 2004-2005) there's no change in time zone
# adjustment in Cuba.  We will stay in daylight saving time:
# http://www.granma.cu/espanol/2005/noviembre/mier9/horario.html

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2006-10-21):
# An article in GRANMA INTERNACIONAL claims that Cuba will end
# the 3 years of permanent DST next weekend, see
# http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2006/octubre/lun16/43horario.html
# "On Saturday night, October 28 going into Sunday, October 29, at 01:00,
# watches should be set back one hour - going back to 00:00 hours - returning
# to the normal schedule....

# From Paul Eggert (2007-03-02):
# <http://www.granma.cubaweb.cu/english/news/art89.html>, dated yesterday,
# says Cuban clocks will advance at midnight on March 10.
# For lack of better information, assume Cuba will use US rules,
# except that it switches at midnight standard time as usual.
#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2007-10-25):
# Carlos Alberto Fonseca Arauz informed me that Cuba will end DST one week
# earlier - on the last Sunday of October, just like in 2006.

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-03-09):
# I'm in Maryland which is now observing United States Eastern Daylight
# Time. At 9:44 local time I used RealPlayer to listen to
# http://media.enet.cu/radioreloj
# a Cuban information station, and heard
# the time announced as "ocho cuarenta y cuatro" ("eight forty-four"),
# indicating that Cuba is still on standard time.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-03-12):
# It seems that Cuba will start DST on Sunday, 2007-03-16...
# It was announced yesterday, according to this source (in Spanish):
# http://www.nnc.cubaweb.cu/marzo-2008/cien-1-11-3-08.htm
#
# Some more background information is posted here:
# https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/cuba-starts-dst-march-16.html
#
# The article also says that Cuba has been observing DST since 1963,
# while Shanks (and tzdata) has 1965 as the first date (except in the
# 1940's). Many other web pages in Cuba also claim that it has been
# observed since 1963, but with the exception of 1970 - an exception
# which is not present in tzdata/Shanks. So there is a chance we need to
# change some historic records as well.
#
# One example:
# http://www.radiohc.cu/espanol/noticias/mar07/11mar/hor.htm

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2008-03-13):
# The Cuban time change has just been confirmed on the most authoritative
# web site, the Granma.  Please check out
# http://www.granma.cubaweb.cu/2008/03/13/nacional/artic10.html
#
# Basically as expected after Steffen Thorsen's information, the change
# will take place midnight between Saturday and Sunday.

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-03-12):
# Assume Sun>=15 (third Sunday) going forward.

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2009-03-04)
# According to the Radio Reloj - Cuba will start Daylight Saving Time on
# midnight between Saturday, March 07, 2009 and Sunday, March 08, 2009-
# not on midnight March 14 / March 15 as previously thought.

# From Arthur David Olson (2009-03-09)
# I listened over the Internet to

# this morning; when it was 10:05 a. m. here in Bethesda, Maryland the
# the time was announced as "diez cinco" - the same time as here, indicating
# that has indeed switched to DST. Assume second Sunday from 2009 forward.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2011-03-08):
# Granma announced that Cuba is going to start DST on 2011-03-20 00:00:00
# this year. Nothing about the end date known so far (if that has

# Haiti
# From Gwillim Law (2005-04-15):
# Risto O. Nykänen wrote me that Haiti is now on DST.
# I searched for confirmation, and I found a press release
# on the Web page of the Haitian Consulate in Chicago (2005-03-31),
# <http://www.haitianconsulate.org/time.doc>.  Translated from French, it says:
#
#  "The Prime Minister's Communication Office notifies the public in general
#   and the press in particular that, following a decision of the Interior
#   Ministry and the Territorial Collectivities [I suppose that means the
#   provinces], Haiti will move to Eastern Daylight Time in the night from next
#   Saturday the 2nd to Sunday the 3rd.
#
#  "Consequently, the Prime Minister's Communication Office wishes to inform
#   the population that the country's clocks will be set forward one hour
#   starting at midnight.  This provision will hold until the last Saturday in
#   October 2005.
#
#  "Port-au-Prince, March 31, 2005"
#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2006-04-04):
# I have been informed by users that Haiti observes DST this year like
# last year, so the current "only" rule for 2005 might be changed to a
# "max" rule or to last until 2006. (Who knows if they will observe DST
# next year or if they will extend their DST like US/Canada next year).
#
# I have found this article about it (in French):
# http://www.haitipressnetwork.com/news.cfm?articleID=7612
#
# The reason seems to be an energy crisis.

# From Stephen Colebourne (2007-02-22):
# Some IATA info: Haiti won't be having DST in 2007.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2012-03-11):
# According to several news sources, Haiti will observe DST this year,
# apparently using the same start and end date as USA/Canada.
# So this means they have already changed their time.
#
# http://www.alterpresse.org/spip.php?article12510
# http://radiovision2000haiti.net/home/?p=13253
#
# From Arthur David Olson (2012-03-11):
# The alterpresse.org source seems to show a US-style leap from 2:00 a.m. to
# 3:00 a.m. rather than the traditional Haitian jump at midnight.
# Assume a US-style fall back as well.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2013-03-10):
# It appears that Haiti is observing DST this year as well, same rules
# as US/Canada.  They did it last year as well, and it looks like they
# are going to observe DST every year now...

#
# From Gwillim Law (2005-04-21):
# The Associated Press story on the time change, which can be found at
# http://www.lapalmainteractivo.com/guias/content/gen/ap/America_Latina/AMC_GEN_NICARAGUA_HORA.html
# and elsewhere, says (fifth paragraph, translated from Spanish): "The last
# time that a change of clocks was applied to save energy was in the year 2000
# during the Arnoldo Alemán administration."...
# The northamerica file says that Nicaragua has been on UTC-6 continuously
# since December 1998.  I wasn't able to find any details of Nicaraguan time
# changes in 2000.  Perhaps a note could be added to the northamerica file, to
# the effect that we have indirect evidence that DST was observed in 2000.

# Turks and Caicos
#
# From Chris Dunn in
# https://bugs.debian.org/415007
# (2007-03-15): In the Turks & Caicos Islands (America/Grand_Turk) the
# daylight saving dates for time changes have been adjusted to match
# the recent U.S. change of dates.
#
# From Brian Inglis (2007-04-28):
# http://www.turksandcaicos.tc/calendar/index.htm [2007-04-26]
# there is an entry for Nov 4 "Daylight Savings Time Ends 2007" and three
# rows before that there is an out of date entry for Oct:
# "Eastern Standard Times Begins 2007
# Clocks are set back one hour at 2:00 a.m. local Daylight Saving Time"
# indicating that the normal ET rules are followed.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-08-19):
# The 2014-08-13 Cabinet meeting decided to stay on UT -04 year-round.  See:
# http://tcweeklynews.com/daylight-savings-time-to-be-maintained-p5353-127.htm
# Model this as a switch from EST/EDT to AST ...
# From Chris Walton (2014-11-04):
# ... the TCI government appears to have delayed the switch to
# "permanent daylight saving time" by one year....
# http://tcweeklynews.com/time-change-to-go-ahead-this-november-p5437-127.htm
#
# From the Turks & Caicos Cabinet (2017-07-20), heads-up from Steffen Thorsen:
# ... agreed to the reintroduction in TCI of Daylight Saving Time (DST)
# during the summer months and Standard Time, also known as Local
# Time, during the winter months with effect from April 2018 ...
# https://www.gov.uk/government/news/turks-and-caicos-post-cabinet-meeting-statement--3
# From Paul Eggert (2017-08-26):
# The date of effect of the spring 2018 change appears to be March 11,
# which makes more sense.  See: Hamilton D. Time change back
# by March 2018 for TCI. Magnetic Media. 2017-08-25.
# http://magneticmediatv.com/2017/08/time-change-back-by-march-2018-for-tci/

# Standard Time Declaration Order 2015 (L.N. 15/2015)
# http://online.fliphtml5.com/fizd/czin/#p=2
#
# Standard Time Declaration Order 2017 (L.N. 31/2017)
# http://online.fliphtml5.com/fizd/dmcu/#p=2
#
# From Tim Parenti (2020-12-05):
# Although L.N. 31/2017 reads that it "shall come into operation at 2:00 a.m.
# on 11th March 2018", a precise interpretation here poses some problems.  The
# order states that "the standard time to be observed throughout the Turks and
# Caicos Islands shall be the same time zone as the Eastern United States of
# America" and further clarifies "[f]or the avoidance of doubt" that it
# "applies to the Eastern Standard Time as well as any changes thereto for
# Daylight Saving Time."  However, as clocks in Turks and Caicos approached
# 02:00 -04, and thus the declared implementation time, it was still 01:00 EST
# (-05), as DST in the Eastern US would not start until an hour later.
#
# Since it is unlikely that those on the islands switched their clocks twice in
# the span of an hour, we assume instead that the adoption of EDT actually took
# effect once clocks in the Eastern US had sprung forward, from 03:00 -04.
# This discrepancy only affects the time zone abbreviation and DST flag for the
# intervening hour, not wall clock times, as -04 was maintained throughout.

#
# From Fabián L. Arce Jofré (2000-04-04):
# The law that claimed DST for Argentina was derogated by President Fernando

# now we'll assume it's for this year only.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-01-31):
# Hora de verano para la República Argentina
# http://buenasiembra.com.ar/esoterismo/astrologia/hora-de-verano-de-la-republica-argentina-27.html
# says that standard time in Argentina from 1894-10-31
# to 1920-05-01 was -4:16:48.25.  Go with this more precise value
# over Shanks & Pottenger.  It is upward compatible with Milne, who
# says Córdoba time was -4:16:48.2.

#
# From Mariano Absatz (2004-06-05):
# These media articles from a major newspaper mostly cover the current state:
# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/04/05/27/de_604825.asp
# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/04/05/28/de_605203.asp
#
# The following eight (8) provinces pulled clocks back to UTC-04:00 at
# midnight Monday May 31st. (that is, the night between 05/31 and 06/01).
# Apparently, all nine provinces would go back to UTC-03:00 at the same
# time in October 17th.
#
# Catamarca, Chubut, La Rioja, San Juan, San Luis, Santa Cruz,
# Tierra del Fuego, Tucumán.
#
# From Mariano Absatz (2004-06-14):
# ... this weekend, the Province of Tucumán decided it'd go back to UTC-03:00
# yesterday midnight (that is, at 24:00 Saturday 12th), since the people's
# annoyance with the change is much higher than the power savings obtained....
#
# From Gwillim Law (2004-06-14):
# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/04/06/10/de_609078.asp ...
#     "The time change in Tierra del Fuego was a conflicted decision from
#   the start.  The government had decreed that the measure would take
#   effect on June 1, but a normative error forced the new time to begin
#   three days earlier, from a Saturday to a Sunday....
# Our understanding was that the change was originally scheduled to take place
# on June 1 at 00:00 in Chubut, Santa Cruz, Tierra del Fuego (and some other
# provinces).  Sunday was May 30, only two days earlier.  So the article
# contains a contradiction.  I would give more credence to the Saturday/Sunday
# date than the "three days earlier" phrase, and conclude that Tierra del
# Fuego set its clocks back at 2004-05-30 00:00.
#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2004-10-05):
# The previous law 7210 which changed the province of Mendoza's time zone
# back in May have been modified slightly in a new law 7277, which set the
# new end date to 2004-09-26 (original date was 2004-10-17).

#
# From Mariano Absatz (2004-10-05):
# San Juan changed from UTC-03:00 to UTC-04:00 at midnight between
# Sunday, May 30th and Monday, May 31st.  It changed back to UTC-03:00

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-01-17):
# Here are articles that Argentina Province San Luis is planning to end DST
# as earlier as upcoming Monday January 21, 2008 or February 2008:
#
# Provincia argentina retrasa reloj y marca diferencia con resto del país
# (Argentine Province delayed clock and mark difference with the rest of the
# country)
# http://cl.invertia.com/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=200801171849_EFE_ET4373&idtel
#
# Es inminente que en San Luis atrasen una hora los relojes

# https://www.lagaceta.com.ar/nota/253414/Economia/Es-inminente-que-en-San-Luis-atrasen-una-hora-los-relojes.html
# http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_argentina02.html

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2008-01-18):
# The page of the San Luis provincial government
# http://www.sanluis.gov.ar/notas.asp?idCanal=0&id=22812
# confirms what Alex Krivenyshev has earlier sent to the tz
# emailing list about that San Luis plans to return to standard
# time much earlier than the rest of the country. It also
# confirms that upon request the provinces San Juan and Mendoza
# refused to follow San Luis in this change.
#
# The change is supposed to take place Monday the 21st at 0:00
# hours. As far as I understand it if this goes ahead, we need
# a new timezone for San Luis (although there are also documented
# independent changes in the southamerica file of San Luis in
# 1990 and 1991 which has not been confirmed).

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2008-01-25):
# Unfortunately the below page has become defunct, about the San Luis
# time change. Perhaps because it now is part of a group of pages "Most
# important pages of 2008."
#
# You can use
# http://www.sanluis.gov.ar/notas.asp?idCanal=8141&id=22834
# instead it seems. Or use "Buscador" from the main page of the San Luis
# government, and fill in "huso" and click OK, and you will get 3 pages
# from which the first one is identical to the above.

# From Mariano Absatz (2008-01-28):
# I can confirm that the Province of San Luis (and so far only that
# province) decided to go back to UTC-3 effective midnight Jan 20th 2008
# (that is, Monday 21st at 0:00 is the time the clocks were delayed back
# 1 hour), and they intend to keep UTC-3 as their timezone all year round
# (that is, unless they change their mind any minute now).
#
# So we'll have to add yet another city to 'southamerica' (I think San
# Luis city is the mos populated city in the Province, so it'd be
# America/Argentina/San_Luis... of course I can't remember if San Luis's
# history of particular changes goes along with Mendoza or San Juan :-(
# (I only remember not being able to collect hard facts about San Luis
# back in 2004, when these provinces changed to UTC-4 for a few days, I
# mailed them personally and never got an answer).

# From Paul Eggert (2014-08-12):
# Unless otherwise specified, data entries are from Shanks & Pottenger through
# 1992, from the IATA otherwise.  As noted below, Shanks & Pottenger say that
# America/Cordoba split into 6 subregions during 1991/1992, one of which
# was America/San_Luis, but we haven't verified this yet so for now we'll
# keep America/Cordoba a single region rather than splitting it into the
# other 5 subregions.

# From Mariano Absatz (2009-03-13):
# Yesterday (with our usual 2-day notice) the Province of San Luis
# decided that next Sunday instead of "staying" @utc-03:00 they will go
# to utc-04:00 until the second Saturday in October...
#
# The press release is at
# http://www.sanluis.gov.ar/SL/Paginas/NoticiaDetalle.asp?TemaId=1&InfoPrensaId=3102
# (I couldn't find the decree, but www.sanluis.gov.ar
# is the official page for the Province Government.)
#
# There's also a note in only one of the major national papers ...
# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1107912
#
# The press release says [quick and dirty translation]:
# ... announced that next Sunday, at 00:00, Puntanos (the San Luis
# inhabitants) will have to turn back one hour their clocks
#
# Since then, San Luis will establish its own Province timezone. Thus,
# during 2009, this timezone change will run from 00:00 the third Sunday
# in March until 24:00 of the second Saturday in October.

# From Mariano Absatz (2009-10-16):
# ...the Province of San Luis is a case in itself.
#
# The Law at
# http://www.diputadossanluis.gov.ar/diputadosasp/paginas/verNorma.asp?NormaID=276
# is ambiguous because establishes a calendar from the 2nd Sunday in
# October at 0:00 thru the 2nd Saturday in March at 24:00 and the
# complement of that starting on the 2nd Sunday of March at 0:00 and
# ending on the 2nd Saturday of March at 24:00.
#
# This clearly breaks every time the 1st of March or October is a Sunday.
#
# IMHO, the "spirit of the Law" is to make the changes at 0:00 on the 2nd
# Sunday of October and March.
#
# The problem is that the changes in the rest of the Provinces that did
# change in 2007/2008, were made according to the Federal Law and Decrees
# that did so on the 3rd Sunday of October and March.
#
# In fact, San Luis actually switched from UTC-4 to UTC-3 last Sunday
# (October 11th) at 0:00.
#
# So I guess a new set of rules, besides "Arg", must be made and the last
# America/Argentina/San_Luis entries should change to use these...
# ...

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2010-04-09):
# According to news reports from El Diario de la República Province San
# Luis, Argentina (standard time UTC-04) will keep Daylight Saving Time
# after April 11, 2010 - will continue to have same time as rest of
# Argentina (UTC-3) (no DST).
#
# Confirmaron la prórroga del huso horario de verano (Spanish)
# http://www.eldiariodelarepublica.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=29383&Itemid=9
# or (some English translation):
# http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_argentina08.html

# From Mariano Absatz (2010-04-12):
# yes...I can confirm this...and given that San Luis keeps calling
# UTC-03:00 "summer time", we should't just let San Luis go back to "Arg"
# rules...San Luis is still using "Western ARgentina Time" and it got
# stuck on Summer daylight savings time even though the summer is over.

# From Paul Eggert (2018-01-23):
# Perhaps San Luis operates on the legal fiction that it is at -04
# with perpetual daylight saving time, but ordinary usage typically seems to
# just say it's at -03; see, for example,
# https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hora_oficial_argentina
# We've documented similar situations as being plain changes to
# standard time, so let's do that here too.  This does not change UTC
# offsets, only tm_isdst and the time zone abbreviations.  One minor
# plus is that this silences a zic complaint that there's no POSIX TZ
# setting for timestamps past 2038.

# Brazil

# From Paul Eggert (1993-11-18):
# The mayor of Rio recently attempted to change the time zone rules
# just in his city, in order to leave more summer time for the tourist trade.
# The rule change lasted only part of the day;
# the federal government refused to follow the city's rules, and business
# was in a chaos, so the mayor backed down that afternoon.

# From IATA SSIM (1996-02):
# _Only_ the following states in BR1 observe DST: Rio Grande do Sul (RS),
# Santa Catarina (SC), Paraná (PR), São Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ),
# Espírito Santo (ES), Minas Gerais (MG), Bahia (BA), Goiás (GO),
# Distrito Federal (DF), Tocantins (TO), Sergipe [SE] and Alagoas [AL].
# [The last three states are new to this issue of the IATA SSIM.]

# From Gwillim Law (1996-10-07):
# Geography, history (Tocantins was part of Goiás until 1989), and other
# sources of time zone information lead me to believe that AL, SE, and TO were
# always in BR1, and so the only change was whether or not they observed DST....
# The earliest issue of the SSIM I have is 2/91.  Each issue from then until
# 9/95 says that DST is observed only in the ten states I quoted from 9/95,
# along with Mato Grosso (MT) and Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), which are in BR2
# (UTC-4)....  The other two time zones given for Brazil are BR3, which is
# UTC-5, no DST, and applies only in the state of Acre (AC); and BR4, which is
# UTC-2, and applies to Fernando de Noronha (formerly FN, but I believe it's
# become part of the state of Pernambuco).  The boundary between BR1 and BR2
# has never been clearly stated.  They've simply been called East and West.
# However, some conclusions can be drawn from another IATA manual: the Airline
# Coding Directory, which lists close to 400 airports in Brazil.  For each
# airport it gives a time zone which is coded to the SSIM.  From that
# information, I'm led to conclude that the states of Amapá (AP), Ceará (CE),
# Maranhão (MA), Paraíba (PR), Pernambuco (PE), Piauí (PI), and Rio Grande do
# Norte (RN), and the eastern part of Pará (PA) are all in BR1 without DST.

# From Marcos Tadeu (1998-09-27):
# Brazilian official page <http://pcdsh01.on.br/verao1.html>

# From Jesper Nørgaard (2000-11-03):

# From Celso Doria via David Madeo (2002-10-09):
# The reason for the delay this year has to do with elections in Brazil.
#
# Unlike in the United States, elections in Brazil are 100% computerized and
# the results are known almost immediately.  Yesterday, it was the first
# round of the elections when 115 million Brazilians voted for President,
# Governor, Senators, Federal Deputies, and State Deputies.  Nobody is
# counting (or re-counting) votes anymore and we know there will be a second
# round for the Presidency and also for some Governors.  The 2nd round will
# take place on October 27th.
#
# The reason why the DST will only begin November 3rd is that the thousands
# of electoral machines used cannot have their time changed, and since the
# Constitution says the elections must begin at 8:00 AM and end at 5:00 PM,
# the Government decided to postpone DST, instead of changing the Constitution
# (maybe, for the next elections, it will be possible to change the clock)...

# From Rodrigo Severo (2004-10-04):
# It's just the biannual change made necessary by the much hyped, supposedly
# modern Brazilian ... voting machines which, apparently, can't deal
# with a time change between the first and the second rounds of the elections.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2007-09-20):
# Brazil will start DST on 2007-10-14 00:00 and end on 2008-02-17 00:00:
# http://www.mme.gov.br/site/news/detail.do;jsessionid=BBA06811AFCAAC28F0285210913513DA?newsId=13975

# From Paul Schulze (2008-06-24):
# ...by law number 11.662 of April 24, 2008 (published in the "Diario
# Oficial da União"...) in Brazil there are changes in the timezones,
# effective today (00:00am at June 24, 2008) as follows:
#
# a) The timezone UTC+5 is extinguished, with all the Acre state and the
# part of the Amazonas state that had this timezone now being put to the
# timezone UTC+4
# b) The whole Pará state now is put at timezone UTC+3, instead of just
# part of it, as was before.
#
# This change follows a proposal of senator Tiao Viana of Acre state, that
# proposed it due to concerns about open television channels displaying
# programs inappropriate to youths in the states that had the timezone
# UTC+5 too early in the night. In the occasion, some more corrections
# were proposed, trying to unify the timezones of any given state. This
# change modifies timezone rules defined in decree 2.784 of 18 June,
# 1913.

# From Rodrigo Severo (2008-06-24):
# Just correcting the URL:
# https://www.in.gov.br/imprensa/visualiza/index.jsp?jornal=do&secao=1&pagina=1&data=25/04/2008
#
# As a result of the above Decree I believe the America/Rio_Branco
# timezone shall be modified from UTC-5 to UTC-4 and a new timezone shall
# be created to represent the...west side of the Pará State. I
# suggest this new timezone be called Santarem as the most
# important/populated city in the affected area.
#
# This new timezone would be the same as the Rio_Branco timezone up to
# the 2008/06/24 change which would be to UTC-3 instead of UTC-4.

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-06-24):
# This is a quick reference page for New and Old Brazil Time Zones map.
# http://www.worldtimezone.com/brazil-time-new-old.php
#
# - 4 time zones replaced by 3 time zones - eliminating time zone UTC-05
# (state Acre and the part of the Amazonas will be UTC/GMT-04) - western
# part of Par state is moving to one timezone UTC-03 (from UTC-04).

# From Paul Eggert (2002-10-10):
# The official decrees referenced below are mostly taken from
# Decretos sobre o Horário de Verão no Brasil.
# http://pcdsh01.on.br/DecHV.html

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-08-29):
# As announced by the government and many newspapers in Brazil late
# yesterday, Brazil will start DST on 2008-10-19 (need to change rule) and
# it will end on 2009-02-15 (current rule for Brazil is fine). Based on
# past years experience with the elections, there was a good chance that
# the start was postponed to November, but it did not happen this year.

# Chile

# From Paul Eggert (2022-03-15):
# Shanks & Pottenger says America/Santiago introduced standard time in
# 1890 and rounds its UT offset to 70W40; guess that in practice this
# was the same offset as in 1916-1919.  It also says Pacific/Easter
# standardized on 109W22 in 1890; assume this didn't change the clocks.
#
# Dates for America/Santiago from 1910 to 2004 are primarily from
# the following source, cited by Oscar van Vlijmen (2006-10-08):
# [1] Chile Law
# http://www.webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/chile.html
# This contains a copy of this official table:
# Cambios en la hora oficial de Chile desde 1900 (retrieved 2008-03-30)
# https://web.archive.org/web/20080330200901/http://www.horaoficial.cl/cambio.htm
# [1] needs several corrections, though.
#
# The first set of corrections is from:
# [2] History of the Official Time of Chile
# http://www.horaoficial.cl/ing/horaof_ing.html (retrieved 2012-03-06).  See:
# https://web.archive.org/web/20120306042032/http://www.horaoficial.cl/ing/horaof_ing.html
# This is an English translation of:
# Historia de la hora oficial de Chile (retrieved 2012-10-24).  See:
# https://web.archive.org/web/20121024234627/http://www.horaoficial.cl/horaof.htm
# A fancier Spanish version (requiring mouse-clicking) is at:
# http://www.horaoficial.cl/historia_hora.php
# Conflicts between [1] and [2] were resolved as follows:
#
#  - [1] says the 1910 transition was Jan 1, [2] says Jan 10 and cites
#    Boletín No. 1, Aviso No. 1 (1910).  Go with [2].
#
#  - [1] says SMT was -4:42:45, [2] says Chile's official time from
#    1916 to 1919 was -4:42:46.3, the meridian of Chile's National
#    Astronomical Observatory (OAN), then located in what is now
#    Quinta Normal in Santiago.  Go with [1], as this matches the meridian
#    referred to by the relevant Chilean laws to this day.
#
#  - [1] says the 1918 transition was Sep 1, [2] says Sep 10 and cites
#    Boletín No. 22, Aviso No. 129/1918 (1918-08-23).  Go with [2].
#
#  - [1] does not give times for transitions; assume they occur
#    at midnight mainland time, the current common practice.  However,
#    go with [2]'s specification of 23:00 for the 1947-05-21 transition.
#
# Another correction to [1] is from Jesper Nørgaard Welen, who
# wrote (2006-10-08), "I think that there are some obvious mistakes in
# the suggested link from Oscar van Vlijmen,... for instance entry 66
# says that GMT-4 ended 1990-09-12 while entry 67 only begins GMT-3 at
# 1990-09-15 (they should have been 1990-09-15 and 1990-09-16
# respectively), but anyhow it clears up some doubts too."
#
# Data for Pacific/Easter from 1910 through 1967 come from Shanks &
# Pottenger.  After that, for lack of better info assume
# Pacific/Easter is always two hours behind America/Santiago;
# this is known to work for DST transitions starting in 2008 and
# may well be true for earlier transitions.

# From Tim Parenti (2022-07-06):
# For a brief period of roughly six weeks in 1946, DST was only observed on an
# emergency basis in specific regions of central Chile; namely, "the national
# territory between the provinces of Coquimbo and Concepción, inclusive".
# This was enacted by Decree 3,891, dated 1946-07-13, and took effect
# 1946-07-14 24:00, advancing these central regions to -03.
# https://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/versiones-anteriores/do-h/19460715/#page/1
# The decree contemplated "[t]hat this advancement of the Official Time, even
# though it has been proposed for the cities of Santiago and Valparaíso only,
# must be agreed with that of other cities, due to the connection of various
# activities that require it, such as, for example, the operation of rail
# services".  It was originally set to expire after 30 days but was extended
# through 1946-08-31 by Decree 4,506, dated 1946-08-13.
# https://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/versiones-anteriores/do-h/19460814/#page/1
#
# Law Number 8,522, promulgated 1946-08-27, reunified Chilean clocks at their
# new "Summer Time" of -04, reckoned as that of "the meridian of the
# Astronomical Observatory of Lo Espejo, advanced by 42 minutes and 45
# seconds".  Although this law specified the new Summer Time to start on 1
# September each year, a special "transitional article" started it a few days
# early, as soon as the law took effect.  As the law was to take force "from
# the date of its publication in the 'Diario Oficial', which happened the
# following day, presume the change took place in Santiago and its environs
# from 24:00 -03 to 23:00 -04 on Wednesday 1946-08-28.  Although this was a
# no-op for wall clocks in the north and south of the country, put their formal
# start to DST an hour later when they reached 24:00 -04.
# https://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/versiones-anteriores/do-h/19460828/#page/1
# After a brief "Winter Time" stint at -05 beginning 1947-04-01, Law Number
# 8,777, promulgated 1947-05-17, established year-round -04 "from 23:00 on the
# second day after it is published in the 'Diario Oficial'."  It was published
# on Monday 1947-05-19 and so took effect from Wednesday 1947-05-21 23:00.
# https://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/versiones-anteriores/do-h/19470519/#page/1

# From Eduardo Krell (1995-10-19):
# The law says to switch to DST at midnight [24:00] on the second SATURDAY
# of October....  The law is the same for March and October.
# (1998-09-29):
# Because of the drought this year, the government decided to go into
# DST earlier (saturday 9/26 at 24:00). This is a one-time change only ...
# (unless there's another dry season next year, I guess).

# From Julio I. Pacheco Troncoso (1999-03-18):
# Because of the same drought, the government decided to end DST later,
# on April 3, (one-time change).

# From Germán Poo-Caamaño (2008-03-03):
# Due to drought, Chile extends Daylight Time in three weeks.  This
# is one-time change (Saturday 3/29 at 24:00 for America/Santiago
# and Saturday 3/29 at 22:00 for Pacific/Easter)

# Subject: DST in Chile exceptionally extended to 3 April due to earthquake
# http://www.gobiernodechile.cl/viewNoticia.aspx?idArticulo=30098
#
# From Arthur David Olson (2010-03-06):
# Angel Chiang's message confirmed by Julio Pacheco; Julio provided a patch.

# In English:
# Chile's clocks will go back an hour this year on the 7th of May instead
# of this Saturday. They will go forward again the 3rd Saturday in
# August, not in October as they have since 1968.

# From Mauricio Parada (2012-02-22), translated by Glenn Eychaner (2012-02-23):
# As stated in the website of the Chilean Energy Ministry
# http://www.minenergia.cl/ministerio/noticias/generales/gobierno-anuncia-fechas-de-cambio-de.html
# The Chilean Government has decided to postpone the entrance into winter time
# (to leave DST) from March 11 2012 to April 28th 2012....
# Quote from the website communication:
#
# 6. For the year 2012, the dates of entry into winter time will be as follows:
# a. Saturday April 28, 2012, clocks should go back 60 minutes; that is, at
# 23:59:59, instead of passing to 0:00, the time should be adjusted to be 23:00
# of the same day.
# b. Saturday, September 1, 2012, clocks should go forward 60 minutes; that is,
# at 23:59:59, instead of passing to 0:00, the time should be adjusted to be
# 01:00 on September 2.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2013-02-15):
# According to several news sources, Chile has extended DST this year,
# they will end DST later and start DST earlier than planned.  They
# hope to save energy.  The new end date is 2013-04-28 00:00 and new
# start date is 2013-09-08 00:00....
# http://www.gob.cl/informa/2013/02/15/gobierno-anuncia-fechas-de-cambio-de-hora-para-el-ano-2013.htm

# From José Miguel Garrido (2014-02-19):
# Today appeared in the Diario Oficial a decree amending the time change
# dates to 2014.
# DST End: last Saturday of April 2014 (Sun 27 Apr 2014 03:00 UTC)
# DST Start: first Saturday of September 2014 (Sun 07 Sep 2014 04:00 UTC)
# http://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl//media/2014/02/19/do-20140219.pdf

# From Eduardo Romero Urra (2015-03-03):
# Today has been published officially that Chile will use the DST time
# permanently until March 25 of 2017
# http://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/media/2015/03/03/1-large.jpg
#
# From Paul Eggert (2015-03-03):
# For now, assume that the extension will persist indefinitely.

# From Juan Correa (2016-03-18):
# The decree regarding DST has been published in today's Official Gazette:
# http://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/versiones-anteriores/do/20160318/
# http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=1088502
# It does consider the second Saturday of May and August as the dates
# for the transition; and it lists DST dates until 2019, but I think
# this scheme will stick.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2016-03-18):
# For now, assume the pattern holds for the indefinite future.
# The decree says transitions occur at 24:00; in practice this appears
# to mean 24:00 mainland time, not 24:00 local time, so that Easter
# Island is always two hours behind the mainland.

# From Juan Correa (2016-12-04):
# Magallanes region ... will keep DST (UTC -3) all year round....
# http://www.soychile.cl/Santiago/Sociedad/2016/12/04/433428/Bachelet-firmo-el-decreto-para-establecer-un-horario-unico-para-la-Region-de-Magallanes.aspx

# From Juan Correa (2018-08-13):
# As of moments ago, the Ministry of Energy in Chile has announced the new
# schema for DST. ...  Announcement in video (in Spanish):
# https://twitter.com/MinEnergia/status/1029000399129374720
# From Yonathan Dossow (2018-08-13):
# The video says "first Saturday of September", we all know it means Sunday at
# midnight.
# From Tim Parenti (2018-08-13):
# Translating the captions on the video at 0:44-0:55, "We want to announce as
# Government that from 2019, Winter Time will be increased to 5 months, between
# the first Saturday of April and the first Saturday of September."
# At 2:08-2:20, "The Magallanes region will maintain its current time, as
# decided by the citizens during 2017, but our Government will promote a
# regional dialogue table to gather their opinion on this matter."
# https://twitter.com/MinEnergia/status/1029009354001973248
# "We will keep the new time policy unchanged for at least the next 4 years."
# So we extend the new rules on Saturdays at 24:00 mainland time indefinitely.
# From Juan Correa (2019-02-04):
# http://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/publicaciones/2018/11/23/42212/01/1498738.pdf

# From Juan Correa (2022-04-02):
# I found there was a decree published last Thursday that will keep
# Magallanes region to UTC -3 "indefinitely". The decree is available at
# https://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/publicaciones/2022/03/31/43217-B/01/2108910.pdf

# From Juan Correa (2022-08-09):
# the Internal Affairs Ministry (Ministerio del Interior) informed DST
# for America/Santiago will start on midnight of September 11th;
# and will end on April 1st, 2023. Magallanes region (America/Punta_Arenas)
# will keep UTC -3 "indefinitely"...  This is because on September 4th
# we will have a voting whether to approve a new Constitution.

#
# From Paul Eggert (2022-08-17):
# Although the presidential decree stops at fall 2026, assume that
# similar DST rules will continue thereafter.

# This says President Sixto Durán Ballén signed decree No. 285, which

# times.  The people called it "hora de Sixto" ("Sixto hour").  The change did

# that included "Amanecía en mitad de la noche, los guaguas iban a clase sin
# sol" ("It was dawning in the middle of the night, the buses went to class
# without sun").  Although Ballén's campaign slogan was "Ni un paso atrás"
# (Not one step back), the clocks went back in 1993 and the experiment was not
# repeated.  For now, assume transitions were at 00:00 local time country-wide.

# Falklands

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Between 1990 and 2000 inclusive, Shanks & Pottenger and the IATA agree except
# the IATA gives 1996-09-08.  Go with Shanks & Pottenger.

# From Falkland Islands Government Office, London (2001-01-22)
# via Jesper Nørgaard:
# ... the clocks revert back to Local Mean Time at 2 am on Sunday 15
# April 2001 and advance one hour to summer time at 2 am on Sunday 2
# September.  It is anticipated that the clocks will revert back at 2
# am on Sunday 21 April 2002 and advance to summer time at 2 am on
# Sunday 1 September.

# From Rives McDow (2001-02-13):
#
# I have communicated several times with people there, and the last
# time I had communications that was helpful was in 1998.  Here is
# what was said then:
#
# "The general rule was that Stanley used daylight saving and the Camp
# did not. However for various reasons many people in the Camp have
# started to use daylight saving (known locally as 'Stanley Time')
# There is no rule as to who uses daylight saving - it is a matter of
# personal choice and so it is impossible to draw a map showing who
# uses it and who does not. Any list would be out of date as soon as
# it was produced. This year daylight saving ended on April 18/19th
# and started again on September 12/13th.  I do not know what the rule
# is, but can find out if you like.  We do not change at the same time
# as UK or Chile."
#
# I did have in my notes that the rule was "Second Saturday in Sep at
# 0:00 until third Saturday in Apr at 0:00".  I think that this does
# not agree in some cases with Shanks; is this true?
#
# Also, there is no mention in the list that some areas in the
# Falklands do not use DST.  I have found in my communications there
# that these areas are on the western half of East Falkland and all of
# West Falkland.  Stanley is the only place that consistently observes
# DST.  Again, as in other places in the world, the farmers don't like
# it.  West Falkland is almost entirely sheep farmers.
#
# I know one lady there that keeps a list of which farm keeps DST and
# which doesn't each year.  She runs a shop in Stanley, and says that
# the list changes each year.  She uses it to communicate to her
# customers, catching them when they are home for lunch or dinner.

# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-05):
# For now, we'll just record the time in Stanley, since we have no
# better info.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2011-04-01):
# The Falkland Islands will not turn back clocks this winter, but stay on
# daylight saving time.
#
# One source:
# http://www.falklandnews.com/public/story.cfm?get=5914&source=3
#
# We have gotten this confirmed by a clerk of the legislative assembly:
# Normally the clocks revert to Local Mean Time (UTC/GMT -4 hours) on the
# third Sunday of April at 0200hrs and advance to Summer Time (UTC/GMT -3
# hours) on the first Sunday of September at 0200hrs.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: During 2011, on a trial basis, the Falkland Islands
# will not revert to local mean time, but clocks will remain on Summer
# time (UTC/GMT - 3 hours) throughout the whole of 2011.  Any long term
# change to local time following the trial period will be notified.
#
# From Andrew Newman (2012-02-24)
# A letter from Justin McPhee, Chief Executive,
# Cable & Wireless Falkland Islands (dated 2012-02-22)
# states...
#   The current Atlantic/Stanley entry under South America expects the
#   clocks to go back to standard Falklands Time (FKT) on the 15th April.
#   The database entry states that in 2011 Stanley was staying on fixed
#   summer time on a trial basis only.  FIG need to contact IANA and/or
#   the maintainers of the database to inform them we're adopting
#   the same policy this year and suggest recommendations for future years.
#
# For now we will assume permanent -03 for the Falklands
# until advised differently (to apply for 2012 and beyond, after the 2011
# experiment was apparently successful.)

# by 44 minutes 51 seconds (UT-03) "from 30 September to 31 March", and by 14
# minutes 51 seconds (UT-03:30) "the rest of the year"; a message from the
# National Council of Administration the same day, published directly below the
# law in the Diario Oficial, specified the first transition to be 1923-09-30
# 24:00.  This effectively established standard time at UT-03:30 with 30
# minutes DST.  Assume transitions at 24:00 on the specified days until Ley No.
# 7919 of 1926-03-05 ended this arrangement, repealing all "laws and other
# provisions which oppose" it, resulting in year-round UT-03:30; a Resolución
# of 1926-03-11 puts the final transition at 1926-03-31 24:00, the same as it
# would have been under the previous law.

# From Tim Parenti (2018-02-15):
# http://www.impo.com.uy/diariooficial/1933/10/27/6
#
# It appears Ley No. 9122 of 1933 was never published as such in the Diario
# Oficial, but instead appeared as Document 26 in the Diario on Friday
# 1933-10-27 as a decree made Monday 1933-10-23 and filed under the Ministry of
# National Defense.  It reinstituted a DST of 30 minutes (to UT-03) "from the
# last Sunday of October...until the last Saturday of March."  In accordance
# with this provision, the first transition was explicitly specified in Article
# 2 of the decree as Saturday 1933-10-28 at 24:00; that is, Sunday 1933-10-29
# at 00:00.  Assume transitions at 00:00 Sunday throughout.
#
# Departing from the matter-of-fact nature of previous timekeeping laws, the
# 1933 decree "consider[s] the advantages of...the advance of legal time":
#
#   "Whereas: The measure adopted by almost all nations at the time of the last
#    World War still persists in North America and Europe, precisely because of
#    the economic, hygienic, and social advantages derived from such an
#    emergency measure...
#
#    Whereas: The advance of the legal time during the summer seasons, by
#    displacing social activity near sunrise, favors the citizen populations
#    and especially the society that creates and works..."
#
# It further specified that "necessary measures" be taken to ensure that
# "public spectacles finish, in general, before [01:00]."

# From Tim Parenti (2018-02-15):
# Most of the Rules below, and their contemporaneous Zone lines, have been
# updated simply to match the Almanaque 2018.  Although the document does not
# list exact transition times, midnight transitions were already present in our
# data here for all transitions through 2004-09, and this is both consistent
# with prior transitions and verified in several decrees marked below between
# 1939-09 and 2004-09, wherein the relevant text was typically of the form:
#
#   "From 0 hours on [date], the legal time of the entire Republic will be...
#
#    In accordance with [the preceding], on [previous date] at 24 hours, all
#    clocks throughout the Republic will be [advanced/retarded] by..."
#
# It is possible that there is greater specificity to be found for the Rules
# below, but it is buried in no fewer than 40 different decrees individually
# referenced by the Almanaque for the period from 1939-09 to 2014-09.
# Four-fifths of these were promulgated less than two weeks before taking
# effect; more than half within a week and none more than 5 weeks.  Only the
# handful with comments below have been checked with any thoroughness.

<section>
  <h2 id="scope">Scope of the <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database</h2>
<p>
The <a
href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones"><code><abbr>tz</abbr></code>
database</a> attempts to record the history and predicted future of
civil time scales.
It organizes <a href="tz-link.html">time zone and daylight saving time
data</a> by partitioning the world into <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones"><dfn>timezones</dfn></a>
whose clocks all agree about timestamps that occur after the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">POSIX Epoch</a>
(1970-01-01 00:00:00 <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time"><abbr
title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr></a>).
Although 1970 is a somewhat-arbitrary cutoff, there are significant
challenges to moving the cutoff earlier even by a decade or two, due
to the wide variety of local practices before computer timekeeping
became prevalent.
Most timezones correspond to a notable location and the database
records all known clock transitions for that location;
some timezones correspond instead to a fixed <abbr>UTC</abbr> offset.
</p>

<p>
Each timezone typically corresponds to a geographical region that is
smaller than a traditional time zone, because clocks in a timezone
all agree after 1970 whereas a traditional time zone merely
specifies current standard time. For example, applications that deal
with current and future timestamps in the traditional North
American mountain time zone can choose from the timezones
<code>America/Denver</code> which observes US-style daylight saving
time (<abbr>DST</abbr>),
and <code>America/Phoenix</code> which does not observe <abbr>DST</abbr>.
Applications that also deal with past timestamps in the mountain time
zone can choose from over a dozen timezones, such as
<code>America/Boise</code>, <code>America/Edmonton</code>, and
<code>America/Hermosillo</code>, each of which currently uses mountain
time but differs from other timezones for some timestamps after 1970.
</p>

<p>
Clock transitions before 1970 are recorded for location-based timezones,
because most systems support timestamps before 1970 and could
misbehave if data entries were omitted for pre-1970 transitions.
However, the database is not designed for and does not suffice for
applications requiring accurate handling of all past times everywhere,
as it would take far too much effort and guesswork to record all
details of pre-1970 civil timekeeping.
Although some information outside the scope of the database is
collected in a file <code>backzone</code> that is distributed along
with the database proper, this file is less reliable and does not
necessarily follow database guidelines.
</p>

<p>
As described below, reference source code for using the
<code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database is also available.
The <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> code is upwards compatible with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">POSIX</a>, an international
standard for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">UNIX</a>-like systems.
As of this writing, the current edition of POSIX is: <a
href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/"> The Open
Group Base Specifications Issue 7</a>, IEEE Std 1003.1-2017, 2018
Edition.
Because the database's scope encompasses real-world changes to civil
timekeeping, its model for describing time is more complex than the
standard and daylight saving times supported by POSIX.
A <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> timezone corresponds to a ruleset that can
have more than two changes per year, these changes need not merely
flip back and forth between two alternatives, and the rules themselves
can change at times.
Whether and when a timezone changes its clock,
and even the timezone's notional base offset from <abbr>UTC</abbr>,
are variable.
It does not always make sense to talk about a timezone's
"base offset", which is not necessarily a single number.
</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="naming">Timezone identifiers</h2>
<p>
Each timezone has a name that uniquely identifies the timezone.
Inexperienced users are not expected to select these names unaided.
Distributors should provide documentation and/or a simple selection
interface that explains each name via a map or via descriptive text like
"Czech Republic" instead of the timezone name "<code>Europe/Prague</code>".
If geolocation information is available, a selection interface can
locate the user on a timezone map or prioritize names that are
geographically close. For an example selection interface, see the
<code>tzselect</code> program in the <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> code.
The <a href="https://cldr.unicode.org">Unicode Common Locale Data
Repository</a> contains data that may be useful for other selection
interfaces; it maps timezone names like <code>Europe/Prague</code> to
locale-dependent strings like "Prague", "Praha", "Прага", and "布拉格".
</p>

<p>
The naming conventions attempt to strike a balance
among the following goals:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Uniquely identify every timezone where clocks have agreed since 1970.
    This is essential for the intended use: static clocks keeping local
    civil time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Indicate to experts where the timezone's clocks typically are.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be robust in the presence of political changes.
    For example, names are typically not tied to countries, to avoid
    incompatibilities when countries change their name (e.g.,
    Swaziland&rarr;Eswatini) or when locations change countries (e.g., Hong
    Kong from UK colony to China).
    There is no requirement that every country or national
    capital must have a timezone name.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be portable to a wide variety of implementations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use a consistent naming conventions over the entire world.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Names normally have the form
<var>AREA</var><code>/</code><var>LOCATION</var>, where
<var>AREA</var> is a continent or ocean, and
<var>LOCATION</var> is a specific location within the area.
North and South America share the same area, '<code>America</code>'.
Typical names are '<code>Africa/Cairo</code>',
'<code>America/New_York</code>', and '<code>Pacific/Honolulu</code>'.
Some names are further qualified to help avoid confusion; for example,
'<code>America/Indiana/Petersburg</code>' distinguishes Petersburg,
Indiana from other Petersburgs in America.
</p>

<p>
Here are the general guidelines used for
choosing timezone names,
in decreasing order of importance:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Use only valid POSIX file name components (i.e., the parts of
    names other than '<code>/</code>').
    Do not use the file name components '<code>.</code>' and
    '<code>..</code>'.
    Within a file name component, use only <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> letters,
    '<code>.</code>', '<code>-</code>' and '<code>_</code>'.
    Do not use digits, as that might create an ambiguity with <a
    href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html#tag_08_03">POSIX
    <code>TZ</code> strings</a>.
    A file name component must not exceed 14 characters or start with
    '<code>-</code>'.
    E.g., prefer <code>America/Noronha</code> to
    <code>America/Fernando_de_Noronha</code>.
    Exceptions: see the discussion of legacy names below.
  </li>
  <li>
    A name must not be empty, or contain '<code>//</code>', or
    start or end with '<code>/</code>'.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not use names that differ only in case.
    Although the reference implementation is case-sensitive, some
    other implementations are not, and they would mishandle names
    differing only in case.
  </li>
  <li>
    If one name <var>A</var> is an initial prefix of another
    name <var>AB</var> (ignoring case), then <var>B</var> must not
    start with '<code>/</code>', as a regular file cannot have the
    same name as a directory in POSIX.
    For example, <code>America/New_York</code> precludes
    <code>America/New_York/Bronx</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Uninhabited regions like the North Pole and Bouvet Island
    do not need locations, since local time is not defined there.
  </li>
  <li>
    If all the clocks in a timezone have agreed since 1970,
    do not bother to include more than one timezone
    even if some of the clocks disagreed before 1970.
    Otherwise these tables would become annoyingly large.
  </li>
  <li>
    If boundaries between regions are fluid, such as during a war or
    insurrection, do not bother to create a new timezone merely
    because of yet another boundary change. This helps prevent table
    bloat and simplifies maintenance.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a name is ambiguous, use a less ambiguous alternative;
    e.g., many cities are named San José and Georgetown, so
    prefer <code>America/Costa_Rica</code> to
    <code>America/San_Jose</code> and <code>America/Guyana</code>
    to <code>America/Georgetown</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep locations compact.
    Use cities or small islands, not countries or regions, so that any
    future changes do not split individual locations into different
    timezones.
    E.g., prefer <code>Europe/Paris</code> to <code>Europe/France</code>,
    since
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_France#History">France
    has had multiple time zones</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use mainstream English spelling, e.g., prefer
    <code>Europe/Rome</code> to <code>Europa/Roma</code>, and
    prefer <code>Europe/Athens</code> to the Greek
    <code>Ευρώπη/Αθήνα</code> or the Romanized
    <code>Evrópi/Athína</code>.
    The POSIX file name restrictions encourage this guideline.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the most populous among locations in a region,
    e.g., prefer <code>Asia/Shanghai</code> to
    <code>Asia/Beijing</code>.
    Among locations with similar populations, pick the best-known
    location, e.g., prefer <code>Europe/Rome</code> to
    <code>Europe/Milan</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the singular form, e.g., prefer <code>Atlantic/Canary</code> to
    <code>Atlantic/Canaries</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Omit common suffixes like '<code>_Islands</code>' and
    '<code>_City</code>', unless that would lead to ambiguity.
    E.g., prefer <code>America/Cayman</code> to
    <code>America/Cayman_Islands</code> and
    <code>America/Guatemala</code> to
    <code>America/Guatemala_City</code>, but prefer
    <code>America/Mexico_City</code> to
    <code>America/Mexico</code>
    because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Mexico">the
    country of Mexico has several time zones</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use '<code>_</code>' to represent a space.
  </li>
  <li>
    Omit '<code>.</code>' from abbreviations in names.
    E.g., prefer <code>Atlantic/St_Helena</code> to
    <code>Atlantic/St._Helena</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not change established names if they only marginally violate
    the above guidelines.
    For example, do not change the existing name <code>Europe/Rome</code> to
    <code>Europe/Milan</code> merely because Milan's population has grown
    to be somewhat greater than Rome's.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a name is changed, put its old spelling in the
    '<code>backward</code>' file as a link to the new spelling.
    This means old spellings will continue to work.
    Ordinarily a name change should occur only in the rare case when
    a location's consensus English-language spelling changes; for example,
    in 2008 <code>Asia/Calcutta</code> was renamed to <code>Asia/Kolkata</code>
    due to long-time widespread use of the new city name instead of the old.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Guidelines have evolved with time, and names following old versions of
these guidelines might not follow the current version. When guidelines
have changed, old names continue to be supported. Guideline changes
have included the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Older versions of this package used a different naming scheme.
See the file '<code>backward</code>' for most of these older names
(e.g., '<code>US/Eastern</code>' instead of '<code>America/New_York</code>').
The other old-fashioned names still supported are
'<code>WET</code>', '<code>CET</code>', '<code>MET</code>', and
'<code>EET</code>' (see the file '<code>europe</code>').
</li>

<li>
Older versions of this package defined legacy names that are
incompatible with the first guideline of location names, but which are
still supported.
These legacy names are mostly defined in the file
'<code>etcetera</code>'.
Also, the file '<code>backward</code>' defines the legacy names
'<code>Etc/GMT0</code>', '<code>Etc/GMT-0</code>', '<code>Etc/GMT+0</code>',
'<code>GMT0</code>', '<code>GMT-0</code>' and '<code>GMT+0</code>',
and the file '<code>northamerica</code>' defines the legacy names
'<code>EST5EDT</code>', '<code>CST6CDT</code>',
'<code>MST7MDT</code>', and '<code>PST8PDT</code>'.
</li>

<li>
Older versions of these guidelines said that
there should typically be at least one name for each <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1"><abbr
title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr>
3166-1</a> officially assigned two-letter code for an inhabited
country or territory.
This old guideline has been dropped, as it was not needed to handle
timestamps correctly and it increased maintenance burden.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The file <code>zone1970.tab</code> lists geographical locations used
to name timezones.
It is intended to be an exhaustive list of names for geographic
regions as described above; this is a subset of the timezones in the data.
Although a <code>zone1970.tab</code> location's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude">longitude</a>
corresponds to
its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_mean_time">local mean
time (<abbr>LMT</abbr>)</a> offset with one hour for every 15&deg;
east longitude, this relationship is not exact.
The backward-compatibility file <code>zone.tab</code> is similar
but conforms to the older-version guidelines related to <abbr>ISO</abbr> 3166-1;
it lists only one country code per entry and unlike <code>zone1970.tab</code>
it can list names defined in <code>backward</code>.
</p>

<p>
The database defines each timezone name to be a zone, or a link to a zone.
The source file <code>backward</code> defines links for backward
compatibility; it does not define zones.
Although <code>backward</code> was originally designed to be optional,
nowadays distributions typically use it
and no great weight should be attached to whether a link
is defined in <code>backward</code> or in some other file.
The source file <code>etcetera</code> defines names that may be useful
on platforms that do not support POSIX-style <code>TZ</code> strings;
no other source file other than <code>backward</code>
contains links to its zones.
One of <code>etcetera</code>'s names is <code>Etc/UTC</code>,
used by functions like <code>gmtime</code> to obtain leap
second information on platforms that support leap seconds.
Another <code>etcetera</code> name, <code>GMT</code>,
is used by older code releases.
</p>

<section>
  <h2 id="abbreviations">Time zone abbreviations</h2>
<p>
When this package is installed, it generates time zone abbreviations
like '<code>EST</code>' to be compatible with human tradition and POSIX.
Here are the general guidelines used for choosing time zone abbreviations,
in decreasing order of importance:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Use three to six characters that are ASCII alphanumerics or
    '<code>+</code>' or '<code>-</code>'.
    Previous editions of this database also used characters like
    space and '<code>?</code>', but these characters have a
    special meaning to the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell">UNIX shell</a>
    and cause commands like
    '<code><a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#set">set</a>
    `<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/date.html">date</a>`</code>'
    to have unexpected effects.
    Previous editions of this guideline required upper-case letters, but the
    Congressman who introduced
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamorro_Time_Zone">Chamorro
    Standard Time</a> preferred "ChST", so lower-case letters are now
    allowed.
    Also, POSIX from 2001 on relaxed the rule to allow '<code>-</code>',
    '<code>+</code>', and alphanumeric characters from the portable
    character set in the current locale.
    In practice ASCII alphanumerics and '<code>+</code>' and
    '<code>-</code>' are safe in all locales.

    <p>
    In other words, in the C locale the POSIX extended regular
    expression <code>[-+[:alnum:]]{3,6}</code> should match the
    abbreviation.
    This guarantees that all abbreviations could have been specified by a
    POSIX <code>TZ</code> string.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Use abbreviations that are in common use among English-speakers,
    e.g., 'EST' for Eastern Standard Time in North America.
    We assume that applications translate them to other languages
    as part of the normal localization process; for example,
    a French application might translate 'EST' to 'HNE'.

    <p>
    <small>These abbreviations (for standard/daylight/etc. time) are:
      ACST/ACDT Australian Central,
      AST/ADT/APT/AWT/ADDT Atlantic,
      AEST/AEDT Australian Eastern,
      AHST/AHDT Alaska-Hawaii,
      AKST/AKDT Alaska,
      AWST/AWDT Australian Western,
      BST/BDT Bering,
      CAT/CAST Central Africa,
      CET/CEST/CEMT Central European,
      ChST Chamorro,
      CST/CDT/CWT/CPT Central [North America],
      CST/CDT China,
      GMT/BST/IST/BDST Greenwich,
      EAT East Africa,
      EST/EDT/EWT/EPT Eastern [North America],
      EET/EEST Eastern European,
      GST/GDT Guam,
      HST/HDT/HWT/HPT Hawaii,
      HKT/HKST/HKWT Hong Kong,
      IST India,
      IST/GMT Irish,
      IST/IDT/IDDT Israel,
      JST/JDT Japan,
      KST/KDT Korea,
      MET/MEST Middle European (a backward-compatibility alias for
	Central European),
      MSK/MSD Moscow,
      MST/MDT/MWT/MPT Mountain,
      NST/NDT/NWT/NPT/NDDT Newfoundland,
      NST/NDT/NWT/NPT Nome,
      NZMT/NZST New Zealand through 1945,
      NZST/NZDT New Zealand 1946&ndash;present,
      PKT/PKST Pakistan,
      PST/PDT/PWT/PPT Pacific,
      PST/PDT Philippine,
      SAST South Africa,
      SST Samoa,
      UTC Universal,
      WAT/WAST West Africa,
      WET/WEST/WEMT Western European,
      WIB Waktu Indonesia Barat,
      WIT Waktu Indonesia Timur,
      WITA Waktu Indonesia Tengah,
      YST/YDT/YWT/YPT/YDDT Yukon</small>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    For times taken from a city's longitude, use the
    traditional <var>x</var>MT notation.
    The only abbreviation like this in current use is '<abbr>GMT</abbr>'.
    The others are for timestamps before 1960,
    except that Monrovia Mean Time persisted until 1972.
    Typically, numeric abbreviations (e.g., '<code>-</code>004430' for
    MMT) would cause trouble here, as the numeric strings would exceed
    the POSIX length limit.
    </p>

    <p>
    <small>These abbreviations are:
      AMT Asunción, Athens;
      BMT Baghdad, Bangkok, Batavia, Bermuda, Bern, Bogotá,
        Brussels, Bucharest;
      CMT Calamarca, Caracas, Chisinau, Colón, Córdoba;
      DMT Dublin/Dunsink;
      EMT Easter;
      FFMT Fort-de-France;
      FMT Funchal;
      GMT Greenwich;
      HMT Havana, Helsinki, Horta, Howrah;
      IMT Irkutsk, Istanbul;
      JMT Jerusalem;
      KMT Kaunas, Kyiv, Kingston;
      LMT Lima, Lisbon, local;
      MMT Macassar, Madras, Malé, Managua, Minsk, Monrovia, Montevideo,
	Moratuwa, Moscow;
      PLMT Phù Liễn;
      PMT Paramaribo, Paris, Perm, Pontianak, Prague;
      PMMT Port Moresby;
      PPMT Port-au-Prince;
      QMT Quito;
      RMT Rangoon, Riga, Rome;
      SDMT Santo Domingo;
      SJMT San José;
      SMT Santiago, Simferopol, Singapore, Stanley;
      TBMT Tbilisi;
      TMT Tallinn, Tehran;
      WMT Warsaw.</small>
    </p>

    <p>
    <small>A few abbreviations also follow the pattern that
    <abbr>GMT</abbr>/<abbr>BST</abbr> established for time in the UK.
    They are:
      BMT/BST for Bermuda 1890&ndash;1930,
      CMT/BST for Calamarca Mean Time and Bolivian Summer Time
	1890&ndash;1932,
      DMT/IST for Dublin/Dunsink Mean Time and Irish Summer Time
	1880&ndash;1916,
      MMT/MST/MDST for Moscow 1880&ndash;1919, and
      RMT/LST for Riga Mean Time and Latvian Summer time 1880&ndash;1926.
    </small>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Use '<abbr>LMT</abbr>' for local mean time of locations before the
    introduction of standard time; see "<a href="#scope">Scope of the
    <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database</a>".
  </li>
  <li>
    If there is no common English abbreviation, use numeric offsets like
    <code>-</code>05 and <code>+</code>0530 that are generated
    by <code>zic</code>'s <code>%z</code> notation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use current abbreviations for older timestamps to avoid confusion.
    For example, in 1910 a common English abbreviation for time
    in central Europe was 'MEZ' (short for both "Middle European
    Zone" and for "Mitteleuropäische Zeit" in German).
    Nowadays 'CET' ("Central European Time") is more common in
    English, and the database uses 'CET' even for circa-1910
    timestamps as this is less confusing for modern users and avoids
    the need for determining when 'CET' supplanted 'MEZ' in common
    usage.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use a consistent style in a timezone's history.
    For example, if a history tends to use numeric
    abbreviations and a particular entry could go either way, use a
    numeric abbreviation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Time">Universal Time</a>
    (<abbr>UT</abbr>) (with time zone abbreviation '<code>-</code>00') for
    locations while uninhabited.
    The leading '<code>-</code>' is a flag that the <abbr>UT</abbr> offset is in
    some sense undefined; this notation is derived
    from <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339">Internet
    <abbr title="Request For Comments">RFC</abbr> 3339</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Application writers should note that these abbreviations are ambiguous
in practice: e.g., 'CST' means one thing in China and something else
in North America, and 'IST' can refer to time in India, Ireland or
Israel.
To avoid ambiguity, use numeric <abbr>UT</abbr> offsets like
'<code>-</code>0600' instead of time zone abbreviations like 'CST'.

<section>
  <h2 id="accuracy">Accuracy of the <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database</h2>
<p>
The <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database is not authoritative, and it
surely has errors.
Corrections are welcome and encouraged; see the file <code>CONTRIBUTING</code>.
Users requiring authoritative data should consult national standards
bodies and the references cited in the database's comments.
</p>

<p>
Errors in the <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database arise from many sources:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database predicts future
    timestamps, and current predictions
    will be incorrect after future governments change the rules.
    For example, if today someone schedules a meeting for 13:00 next
    October 1, Casablanca time, and tomorrow Morocco changes its
    daylight saving rules, software can mess up after the rule change
    if it blithely relies on conversions made before the change.
  </li>
  <li>
    The pre-1970 entries in this database cover only a tiny sliver of how
    clocks actually behaved; the vast majority of the necessary
    information was lost or never recorded.
    Thousands more timezones would be needed if
    the <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database's scope were extended to
    cover even just the known or guessed history of standard time; for
    example, the current single entry for France would need to split
    into dozens of entries, perhaps hundreds.
    And in most of the world even this approach would be misleading
    due to widespread disagreement or indifference about what times
    should be observed.
    In her 2015 book
    <cite><a
    href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674286146">The
    Global Transformation of Time, 1870&ndash;1950</a></cite>,
    Vanessa Ogle writes
    "Outside of Europe and North America there was no system of time
    zones at all, often not even a stable landscape of mean times,
    prior to the middle decades of the twentieth century".
    See: Timothy Shenk, <a
href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/booked-a-global-history-of-time-vanessa-ogle">Booked:
      A Global History of Time</a>. <cite>Dissent</cite> 2015-12-17.
  </li>
  <li>
    Most of the pre-1970 data entries come from unreliable sources, often
    astrology books that lack citations and whose compilers evidently
    invented entries when the true facts were unknown, without
    reporting which entries were known and which were invented.
    These books often contradict each other or give implausible entries,
    and on the rare occasions when they are checked they are
    typically found to be incorrect.
  </li>
  <li>
    For the UK the <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database relies on
    years of first-class work done by
    Joseph Myers and others; see
    "<a href="https://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/">History of
    legal time in Britain</a>".
    Other countries are not done nearly as well.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sometimes, different people in the same city maintain clocks
    that differ significantly.
    Historically, railway time was used by railroad companies (which
    did not always
    agree with each other), church-clock time was used for birth
    certificates, etc.
    More recently, competing political groups might disagree about
    clock settings. Often this is merely common practice, but
    sometimes it is set by law.
    For example, from 1891 to 1911 the <abbr>UT</abbr> offset in France
    was legally <abbr>UT</abbr> +00:09:21 outside train stations and
    <abbr>UT</abbr> +00:04:21 inside. Other examples include
    Chillicothe in 1920, Palm Springs in 1946/7, and Jerusalem and
    Ürümqi to this day.
  </li>
  <li>
    Although a named location in the <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code>
    database stands for the containing region, its pre-1970 data
    entries are often accurate for only a small subset of that region.
    For example, <code>Europe/London</code> stands for the United
    Kingdom, but its pre-1847 times are valid only for locations that
    have London's exact meridian, and its 1847 transition
    to <abbr>GMT</abbr> is known to be valid only for the L&amp;NW and
    the Caledonian railways.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database does not record the
    earliest time for which a timezone's
    data entries are thereafter valid for every location in the region.
    For example, <code>Europe/London</code> is valid for all locations
    in its region after <abbr>GMT</abbr> was made the standard time,
    but the date of standardization (1880-08-02) is not in the
    <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database, other than in commentary.
    For many timezones the earliest time of
    validity is unknown.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database does not record a
    region's boundaries, and in many cases the boundaries are not known.
    For example, the timezone
    <code>America/Kentucky/Louisville</code> represents a region
    around the city of Louisville, the boundaries of which are
    unclear.
  </li>
  <li>
    Changes that are modeled as instantaneous transitions in the
    <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code>
    database were often spread out over hours, days, or even decades.
  </li>
  <li>
    Even if the time is specified by law, locations sometimes
    deliberately flout the law.
  </li>
  <li>
    Early timekeeping practices, even assuming perfect clocks, were
    often not specified to the accuracy that the
    <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database requires.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database cannot represent stopped clocks.
    However, on 1911-03-11 at 00:00, some public-facing French clocks
    were changed by stopping them for a few minutes to effect a transition.
    The <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database models this via a
    backward transition; the relevant French legislation does not
    specify exactly how the transition was to occur.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sometimes historical timekeeping was specified more precisely
    than what the <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> code can handle.
    For example, from 1880 to 1916 clocks in Ireland observed Dublin Mean
    Time (estimated to be <abbr>UT</abbr>
    &minus;00:25:21.1); although the <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code>
    source data can represent the .1 second, TZif files and the code cannot.
    In practice these old specifications were rarely if ever
    implemented to subsecond precision.
  </li>
  <li>
    Even when all the timestamp transitions recorded by the
    <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database are correct, the
    <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> rules that generate them may not
    faithfully reflect the historical rules.
    For example, from 1922 until World War II the UK moved clocks
    forward the day following the third Saturday in April unless that
    was Easter, in which case it moved clocks forward the previous
    Sunday.
    Because the <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database has no
    way to specify Easter, these exceptional years are entered as
    separate <code><abbr>tz</abbr> Rule</code> lines, even though the
    legal rules did not change.
    When transitions are known but the historical rules behind them are not,
    the database contains <code>Zone</code> and <code>Rule</code>
    entries that are intended to represent only the generated
    transitions, not any underlying historical rules; however, this
    intent is recorded at best only in commentary.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database models time
    using the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar">proleptic
    Gregorian calendar</a> with days containing 24 equal-length hours
    numbered 00 through 23, except when clock transitions occur.
    Pre-standard time is modeled as local mean time.
    However, historically many people used other calendars and other timescales.
    For example, the Roman Empire used
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar">Julian
    calendar</a>,
    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_timekeeping">Roman
    timekeeping</a> had twelve varying-length daytime hours with a
    non-hour-based system at night.
    And even today, some local practices diverge from the Gregorian
    calendar with 24-hour days. These divergences range from
    relatively minor, such as Japanese bars giving times like "24:30" for the
    wee hours of the morning, to more-significant differences such as <a
    href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-01-30/if-you-have-meeting-ethiopia-you-better-double-check-time">the
    east African practice of starting the day at dawn</a>, renumbering
    the Western 06:00 to be 12:00. These practices are largely outside
    the scope of the <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> code and data, which
    provide only limited support for date and time localization
    such as that required by POSIX.
    If <abbr>DST</abbr> is not used a different time zone
    can often do the trick; for example, in Kenya a <code>TZ</code> setting
    like <code>&lt;-03&gt;3</code> or <code>America/Cayenne</code> starts
    the day six hours later than <code>Africa/Nairobi</code> does.
  </li>
  <li>
    Early clocks were less reliable, and data entries do not represent
    clock error.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database assumes Universal Time
    (<abbr>UT</abbr>) as an origin, even though <abbr>UT</abbr> is not
    standardized for older timestamps.
    In the <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database commentary,
    <abbr>UT</abbr> denotes a family of time standards that includes
    Coordinated Universal Time (<abbr>UTC</abbr>) along with other
    variants such as <abbr>UT1</abbr> and <abbr>GMT</abbr>,
    with days starting at midnight.
    Although <abbr>UT</abbr> equals <abbr>UTC</abbr> for modern
    timestamps, <abbr>UTC</abbr> was not defined until 1960, so
    commentary uses the more general abbreviation <abbr>UT</abbr> for
    timestamps that might predate 1960.
    Since <abbr>UT</abbr>, <abbr>UT1</abbr>, etc. disagree slightly,
    and since pre-1972 <abbr>UTC</abbr> seconds varied in length,
    interpretation of older timestamps can be problematic when
    subsecond accuracy is needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Civil time was not based on atomic time before 1972, and we do not
    know the history of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_rotation">earth's
    rotation</a> accurately enough to map <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units"><abbr
    title="International System of Units">SI</abbr></a> seconds to
    historical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time">solar time</a>
    to more than about one-hour accuracy.

  <li>
    The relationship between POSIX time (that is, <abbr>UTC</abbr> but
    ignoring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second">leap
    seconds</a>) and <abbr>UTC</abbr> is not agreed upon.
    This affects time stamps during the leap second era (1972&ndash;2035).
    Although the POSIX
    clock officially stops during an inserted leap second, at least one
    proposed standard has it jumping back a second instead; and in
    practice POSIX clocks more typically either progress glacially during
    a leap second, or are slightly slowed while near a leap second.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database does not represent how
    uncertain its information is.
    Ideally it would contain information about when data entries are
    incomplete or dicey.
    Partial temporal knowledge is a field of active research, though,
    and it is not clear how to apply it here.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
In short, many, perhaps most, of the <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code>
database's pre-1970 and future timestamps are either wrong or
misleading.
Any attempt to pass the
<code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database off as the definition of time
should be unacceptable to anybody who cares about the facts.
In particular, the <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database's
<abbr>LMT</abbr> offsets should not be considered meaningful, and
should not prompt creation of timezones
merely because two locations
differ in <abbr>LMT</abbr> or transitioned to standard time at
different dates.

  <h2 id="functions">Time and date functions</h2>
<p>
The <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> code contains time and date functions
that are upwards compatible with those of POSIX.
Code compatible with this package is already
<a href="tz-link.html#tzdb">part of many platforms</a>, where the
primary use of this package is to update obsolete time-related files.
To do this, you may need to compile the time zone compiler
'<code>zic</code>' supplied with this package instead of using the
system '<code>zic</code>', since the format of <code>zic</code>'s
input is occasionally extended, and a platform may still be shipping
an older <code>zic</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="POSIX">POSIX properties and limitations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
    In POSIX, time display in a process is controlled by the
    environment variable <code>TZ</code>.
    Unfortunately, the POSIX
    <code>TZ</code> string takes a form that is hard to describe and
    is error-prone in practice.
    Also, POSIX <code>TZ</code> strings cannot deal with daylight
    saving time rules not based on the Gregorian calendar (as in
    Morocco), or with situations where more than two time zone
    abbreviations or <abbr>UT</abbr> offsets are used in an area.
    </p>

    <p>
    The POSIX <code>TZ</code> string takes the following form:
    </p>

    <p>
    <var>stdoffset</var>[<var>dst</var>[<var>offset</var>][<code>,</code><var>date</var>[<code>/</code><var>time</var>]<code>,</code><var>date</var>[<code>/</code><var>time</var>]]]
    </p>

    <p>
    where:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><var>std</var> and <var>dst</var></dt><dd>
	are 3 or more characters specifying the standard
	and daylight saving time (<abbr>DST</abbr>) zone abbreviations.
	Starting with POSIX.1-2001, <var>std</var> and <var>dst</var>
	may also be in a quoted form like '<code>&lt;+09&gt;</code>';
	this allows "<code>+</code>" and "<code>-</code>" in the names.
      </dd>
      <dt><var>offset</var></dt><dd>
	is of the form
	'<code>[&plusmn;]<var>hh</var>:[<var>mm</var>[:<var>ss</var>]]</code>'
	and specifies the offset west of <abbr>UT</abbr>.
	'<var>hh</var>' may be a single digit;
	0&le;<var>hh</var>&le;24.
	The default <abbr>DST</abbr> offset is one hour ahead of
	standard time.
      </dd>
      <dt><var>date</var>[<code>/</code><var>time</var>]<code>,</code><var>date</var>[<code>/</code><var>time</var>]</dt><dd>
	specifies the beginning and end of <abbr>DST</abbr>.
	If this is absent, the system supplies its own ruleset
	for <abbr>DST</abbr>, typically	current <abbr>US</abbr>
	<abbr>DST</abbr> rules.
      </dd>
      <dt><var>time</var></dt><dd>
	takes the form
	'<var>hh</var><code>:</code>[<var>mm</var>[<code>:</code><var>ss</var>]]'
	and defaults to 02:00.
	This is the same format as the offset, except that a
	leading '<code>+</code>' or '<code>-</code>' is not allowed.
      </dd>
      <dt><var>date</var></dt><dd>
	takes one of the following forms:
	<dl>
	  <dt>J<var>n</var> (1&le;<var>n</var>&le;365)</dt><dd>
	    origin-1 day number not counting February 29
	  </dd>
	  <dt><var>n</var> (0&le;<var>n</var>&le;365)</dt><dd>
	    origin-0 day number counting February 29 if present
	  </dd>
	  <dt><code>M</code><var>m</var><code>.</code><var>n</var><code>.</code><var>d</var>
	    (0[Sunday]&le;<var>d</var>&le;6[Saturday], 1&le;<var>n</var>&le;5,
	    1&le;<var>m</var>&le;12)</dt><dd>
	    for the <var>d</var>th day of week <var>n</var> of
	    month <var>m</var> of the year, where week 1 is the first
	    week in which day <var>d</var> appears, and
	    '<code>5</code>' stands for the last week in which
	    day <var>d</var> appears (which may be either the 4th or
	    5th week).
	    Typically, this is the only useful form; the <var>n</var>
	    and <code>J</code><var>n</var> forms are rarely used.
	  </dd>
	</dl>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
    Here is an example POSIX <code>TZ</code> string for New
    Zealand after 2007.
    It says that standard time (<abbr>NZST</abbr>) is 12 hours ahead
    of <abbr>UT</abbr>, and that daylight saving time
    (<abbr>NZDT</abbr>) is observed from September's last Sunday at
    02:00 until April's first Sunday at 03:00:
    </p>

    <pre><code>TZ='NZST-12NZDT,M9.5.0,M4.1.0/3'</code></pre>

    <p>
    This POSIX <code>TZ</code> string is hard to remember, and
    mishandles some timestamps before 2008.
    With this package you can use this instead:
    </p>

    <pre><code>TZ='Pacific/Auckland'</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    POSIX does not define the <abbr>DST</abbr> transitions
    for <code>TZ</code> values like
    "<code>EST5EDT</code>".
    Traditionally the current <abbr>US</abbr> <abbr>DST</abbr> rules
    were used to interpret such values, but this meant that the
    <abbr>US</abbr> <abbr>DST</abbr> rules were compiled into each
    time conversion package, and when
    <abbr>US</abbr> time conversion rules changed (as in the United
    States in 1987 and again in 2007), all packages that
    interpreted <code>TZ</code> values had to be updated
    to ensure proper results.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>TZ</code> environment variable is process-global, which
    makes it hard to write efficient, thread-safe applications that
    need access to multiple timezones.
  </li>
  <li>
    In POSIX, there is no tamper-proof way for a process to learn the
    system's best idea of local (wall clock) time.
    This is important for applications that an administrator wants
    used only at certain times &ndash; without regard to whether the
    user has fiddled the
    <code>TZ</code> environment variable.
    While an administrator can "do everything in <abbr>UT</abbr>" to
    get around the problem, doing so is inconvenient and precludes
    handling daylight saving time shifts &ndash; as might be required to
    limit phone calls to off-peak hours.
  </li>
  <li>
    POSIX provides no convenient and efficient way to determine
    the <abbr>UT</abbr> offset and time zone abbreviation of arbitrary
    timestamps, particularly for timezones
    that do not fit into the POSIX model.
  </li>
  <li>
    POSIX requires that <code>time_t</code> clock counts exclude leap
    seconds.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> code attempts to support all the
    <code>time_t</code> implementations allowed by POSIX.
    The <code>time_t</code> type represents a nonnegative count of seconds
    since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 <abbr>UTC</abbr>, ignoring leap seconds.
    In practice, <code>time_t</code> is usually a signed 64- or 32-bit
    integer; 32-bit signed <code>time_t</code> values stop working after
    2038-01-19 03:14:07 <abbr>UTC</abbr>, so new implementations these
    days typically use a signed 64-bit integer.
    Unsigned 32-bit integers are used on one or two platforms, and 36-bit
    and 40-bit integers are also used occasionally.
    Although earlier POSIX versions allowed <code>time_t</code> to be a
    floating-point type, this was not supported by any practical system,
    and POSIX.1-2013 and the <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> code both
    require <code>time_t</code> to be an integer type.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="POSIX-extensions">Extensions to POSIX in the
<code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> code</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
    The <code>TZ</code> environment variable is used in generating
    the name of a file from which time-related information is read
    (or is interpreted à la POSIX); <code>TZ</code> is no longer
    constrained to be a string containing abbreviations
    and numeric data as described <a href="#POSIX">above</a>.
    The file's format is <dfn><abbr>TZif</abbr></dfn>,
    a timezone information format that contains binary data; see
    <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/8536">Internet
    <abbr>RFC</abbr> 8536</a>.
    The daylight saving time rules to be used for a
    particular timezone are encoded in the
    <abbr>TZif</abbr> file; the format of the file allows <abbr>US</abbr>,
    Australian, and other rules to be encoded, and
    allows for situations where more than two time zone
    abbreviations are used.
    </p>
    <p>
    It was recognized that allowing the <code>TZ</code> environment
    variable to take on values such as '<code>America/New_York</code>'
    might cause "old" programs (that expect <code>TZ</code> to have a
    certain form) to operate incorrectly; consideration was given to using
    some other environment variable (for example, <code>TIMEZONE</code>)
    to hold the string used to generate the <abbr>TZif</abbr> file's name.
    In the end, however, it was decided to continue using
    <code>TZ</code>: it is widely used for time zone purposes;
    separately maintaining both <code>TZ</code>
    and <code>TIMEZONE</code> seemed a nuisance; and systems where
    "new" forms of <code>TZ</code> might cause problems can simply
    use legacy <code>TZ</code> values such as "<code>EST5EDT</code>" which
    can be used by "new" programs as well as by "old" programs that
    assume pre-POSIX <code>TZ</code> values.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    The code supports platforms with a <abbr>UT</abbr> offset member
    in <code>struct tm</code>, e.g., <code>tm_gmtoff</code>,
    or with a time zone abbreviation member in
    <code>struct tm</code>, e.g., <code>tm_zone</code>. As noted
    in <a href="https://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=1533">Austin
    Group defect 1533</a>, a future version of POSIX is planned to
    require <code>tm_gmtoff</code> and <code>tm_zone</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Functions <code>tzalloc</code>, <code>tzfree</code>,
    <code>localtime_rz</code>, and <code>mktime_z</code> for
    more-efficient thread-safe applications that need to use multiple
    timezones.
    The <code>tzalloc</code> and <code>tzfree</code> functions
    allocate and free objects of type <code>timezone_t</code>,
    and <code>localtime_rz</code> and <code>mktime_z</code> are
    like <code>localtime_r</code> and <code>mktime</code> with an
    extra <code>timezone_t</code> argument.
    The functions were inspired by <a href="https://netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Negative <code>time_t</code> values are supported, on systems
    where <code>time_t</code> is signed.
  </li>
  <li>
    These functions can account for leap seconds;
    see <a href="#leapsec">Leap seconds</a> below.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="vestigial">POSIX features no longer needed</h3>
<p>
POSIX and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_C"><abbr>ISO</abbr> C</a>
define some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API"><abbr
title="application programming interface">API</abbr>s</a> that are vestigial:
they are not needed, and are relics of a too-simple model that does
not suffice to handle many real-world timestamps.
Although the <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> code supports these
vestigial <abbr>API</abbr>s for backwards compatibility, they should
be avoided in portable applications.
The vestigial <abbr>API</abbr>s are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The POSIX <code>tzname</code> variable does not suffice and is no
    longer needed.
    To get a timestamp's time zone abbreviation, consult
    the <code>tm_zone</code> member if available; otherwise,
    use <code>strftime</code>'s <code>"%Z"</code> conversion
    specification.
  </li>
  <li>
    The POSIX <code>daylight</code> and <code>timezone</code>
    variables do not suffice and are no longer needed.
    To get a timestamp's <abbr>UT</abbr> offset, consult
    the <code>tm_gmtoff</code> member if available; otherwise,
    subtract values returned by <code>localtime</code>
    and <code>gmtime</code> using the rules of the Gregorian calendar,
    or use <code>strftime</code>'s <code>"%z"</code> conversion
    specification if a string like <code>"+0900"</code> suffices.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>tm_isdst</code> member is almost never needed and most of
    its uses should be discouraged in favor of the abovementioned
    <abbr>API</abbr>s.
    Although it can still be used in arguments to
    <code>mktime</code> to disambiguate timestamps near
    a <abbr>DST</abbr> transition when the clock jumps back on
    platforms lacking <code>tm_gmtoff</code>, this
    disambiguation does not work when standard time itself jumps back,
    which can occur when a location changes to a time zone with a
    lesser <abbr>UT</abbr> offset.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-portability">Other portability notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_7_Unix">7th Edition
    UNIX</a> <code>timezone</code> function is not present in this
    package; it is impossible to reliably map <code>timezone</code>'s
    arguments (a "minutes west of <abbr>GMT</abbr>" value and a
    "daylight saving time in effect" flag) to a time zone
    abbreviation, and we refuse to guess.
    Programs that in the past used the <code>timezone</code> function
    may now examine <code>localtime(&amp;clock)-&gt;tm_zone</code>
    (if <code>TM_ZONE</code> is defined) or
    <code>tzname[localtime(&amp;clock)-&gt;tm_isdst]</code>
    (if <code>HAVE_TZNAME</code> is nonzero) to learn the correct time
    zone abbreviation to use.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Berkeley_Software_Distribution#4.2BSD"><abbr>4.2BSD</abbr></a>
    <code>gettimeofday</code> function is not
    used in this package.
    This formerly let users obtain the current <abbr>UTC</abbr> offset
    and <abbr>DST</abbr> flag, but this functionality was removed in
    later versions of <abbr>BSD</abbr>.
  </li>
  <li>
    In <abbr>SVR2</abbr>, time conversion fails for near-minimum or
    near-maximum <code>time_t</code> values when doing conversions
    for places that do not use <abbr>UT</abbr>.
    This package takes care to do these conversions correctly.
    A comment in the source code tells how to get compatibly wrong
    results.
  </li>
  <li>
    The functions that are conditionally compiled
    if <code>STD_INSPIRED</code> is nonzero should, at this point, be
    looked on primarily as food for thought.
    They are not in any sense "standard compatible" &ndash; some are
    not, in fact, specified in <em>any</em> standard.
    They do, however, represent responses of various authors to
    standardization proposals.
  </li>
  <li>
    Other time conversion proposals, in particular those supported by the
    <a href="https://howardhinnant.github.io/date/tz.html">Time Zone
    Database Parser</a>, offer a wider selection of functions
    that provide capabilities beyond those provided here.
    The absence of such functions from this package is not meant to
    discourage the development, standardization, or use of such
    functions.
    Rather, their absence reflects the decision to make this package
    contain valid extensions to POSIX, to ensure its broad
    acceptability.
    If more powerful time conversion functions can be standardized, so
    much the better.
  </li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="stability">Interface stability</h2>
<p>
The <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> code and data supply the following interfaces:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A set of timezone names as per
      "<a href="#naming">Timezone identifiers</a>" above.
  </li>
  <li>
    Library functions described in "<a href="#functions">Time and date
      functions</a>" above.
  </li>
  <li>
    The programs <code>tzselect</code>, <code>zdump</code>,
    and <code>zic</code>, documented in their man pages.
  </li>
  <li>
    The format of <code>zic</code> input files, documented in
    the <code>zic</code> man page.
  </li>
  <li>
    The format of <code>zic</code> output files, documented in
    the <code>tzfile</code> man page.
  </li>
  <li>
    The format of zone table files, documented in <code>zone1970.tab</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The format of the country code file, documented in <code>iso3166.tab</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The version number of the code and data, as the first line of
    the text file '<code>version</code>' in each release.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Interface changes in a release attempt to preserve compatibility with
recent releases.
For example, <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> data files typically do not
rely on recently added <code>zic</code> features, so that users can
run older <code>zic</code> versions to process newer data files.
<a href="tz-link.html#download">Downloading
the <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database</a> describes how releases
are tagged and distributed.
</p>

<p>
Interfaces not listed above are less stable.
For example, users should not rely on particular <abbr>UT</abbr>
offsets or abbreviations for timestamps, as data entries are often
based on guesswork and these guesses may be corrected or improved.
</p>

<p>
Timezone boundaries are not part of the stable interface.
For example, even though the <samp>Asia/Bangkok</samp> timezone
currently includes Chang Mai, Hanoi, and Phnom Penh, this is not part
of the stable interface and the timezone can split at any time.
If a calendar application records a future event in some location other
than Bangkok by putting "<samp>Asia/Bangkok</samp>" in the event's record,
the application should be robust in the presence of timezone splits
between now and the future time.

<section>
  <h2 id="leapsec">Leap seconds</h2>
<p>
Leap seconds were introduced in 1972 to accommodate the
difference between atomic time and the less regular rotation of the earth.
Unfortunately they caused so many problems with civil
timekeeping that they
are <a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/cgpm-2022/resolution-4">planned
to be discontinued by 2035</a>, with some as-yet-undetermined
mechanism replacing them, perhaps after the year 2135.
Despite their impending obsolescence, a record of leap seconds is still
needed to resolve timestamps from 1972 through 2035.
</p>

<p>
The <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> code and data can account for leap seconds,
thanks to code contributed by Bradley White.
However, the leap second support of this package is rarely used directly
because POSIX requires leap seconds to be excluded and many
software packages would mishandle leap seconds if they were present.
Instead, leap seconds are more commonly handled by occasionally adjusting
the operating system kernel clock as described in
<a href="tz-link.html#precision">Precision timekeeping</a>,
and this package by default installs a <samp>leapseconds</samp> file
commonly used by
<a href="https://www.ntp.org"><abbr title="Network Time Protocol">NTP</abbr></a>
software that adjusts the kernel clock.
However, kernel-clock twiddling approximates UTC only roughly,
and systems needing more precise UTC can use this package's leap
second support directly.
</p>

<p>
The directly supported mechanism assumes that <code>time_t</code>
counts of seconds since the POSIX epoch normally include leap seconds,
as opposed to POSIX <code>time_t</code> counts which exclude leap seconds.
This modified timescale is converted to <abbr>UTC</abbr>
at the same point that time zone and <abbr>DST</abbr>
adjustments are applied &ndash;
namely, at calls to <code>localtime</code> and analogous functions &ndash;
and the process is driven by leap second information
stored in alternate versions of the <abbr>TZif</abbr> files.
Because a leap second adjustment may be needed even
if no time zone correction is desired,
calls to <code>gmtime</code>-like functions
also need to consult a <abbr>TZif</abbr> file,
conventionally named <samp><abbr>Etc/UTC</abbr></samp>
(<samp><abbr>GMT</abbr></samp> in previous versions),
to see whether leap second corrections are needed.
To convert an application's <code>time_t</code> timestamps to or from
POSIX <code>time_t</code> timestamps (for use when, say,
embedding or interpreting timestamps in portable
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)"><code>tar</code></a>
files),
the application can call the utility functions
<code>time2posix</code> and <code>posix2time</code>
included with this package.
</p>

<p>
If the POSIX-compatible <abbr>TZif</abbr> file set is installed
in a directory whose basename is <samp>zoneinfo</samp>, the
leap-second-aware file set is by default installed in a separate
directory <samp>zoneinfo-leaps</samp>.
Although each process can have its own time zone by setting
its <code>TZ</code> environment variable, there is no support for some

  <h2 id="calendar">Calendrical issues</h2>
<p>
Calendrical issues are a bit out of scope for a time zone database,
but they indicate the sort of problems that we would run into if we
extended the time zone database further into the past.
An excellent resource in this area is Edward M. Reingold
and Nachum Dershowitz, <cite><a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/fr/academic/subjects/computer-science/computing-general-interest/calendrical-calculations-ultimate-edition-4th-edition">Calendrical
Calculations: The Ultimate Edition</a></cite>, Cambridge University Press (2018).
Other information and sources are given in the file '<code>calendars</code>'
in the <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> distribution.
They sometimes disagree.

  <h2 id="planets">Time and time zones off Earth</h2>
<p>
The European Space Agency is <a
href='https://www.esa.int/Applications/Navigation/Telling_time_on_the_Moon'>considering</a>
the establishment of a reference timescale for the Moon, which has
days roughly equivalent to 29.5 Earth days, and where relativistic
effects cause clocks to tick slightly faster than on Earth.
</p>

<p>
Some people's work schedules have used
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timekeeping_on_Mars">Mars time</a>.
Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) coordinators kept Mars time on
and off during the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Pathfinder">Mars
Pathfinder</a> mission (1997).
Some of their family members also adapted to Mars time.
Dozens of special Mars watches were built for JPL workers who kept
Mars time during the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Exploration_Rover">Mars
Exploration Rovers (MER)</a> mission (2004&ndash;2018).
These timepieces looked like normal Seikos and Citizens but were adjusted
to use Mars seconds rather than terrestrial seconds, although
unfortunately the adjusted watches were unreliable and appear to have
had only limited use.
</p>

<p>
A Mars solar day is called a "sol" and has a mean period equal to
about 24 hours 39 minutes 35.244 seconds in terrestrial time.
It is divided into a conventional 24-hour clock, so each Mars second
equals about 1.02749125 terrestrial seconds.
(One MER worker noted, "If I am working Mars hours, and Mars hours are
2.5% more than Earth hours, shouldn't I get an extra 2.5% pay raise?")
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_meridian">prime
meridian</a> of Mars goes through the center of the crater
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy-0">Airy-0</a>, named in
honor of the British astronomer who built the Greenwich telescope that
defines Earth's prime meridian.
Mean solar time on the Mars prime meridian is
called Mars Coordinated Time (<abbr>MTC</abbr>).
</p>

<p>
Each landed mission on Mars has adopted a different reference for
solar timekeeping, so there is no real standard for Mars time zones.
For example, the MER mission defined two time zones "Local
Solar Time A" and "Local Solar Time B" for its two missions, each zone
designed so that its time equals local true solar time at
approximately the middle of the nominal mission.
The A and B zones differ enough so that an MER worker assigned to
the A zone might suffer "Mars lag" when switching to work in the B zone.
Such a "time zone" is not particularly suited for any application
other than the mission itself.
</p>

<p>
Many calendars have been proposed for Mars, but none have achieved
wide acceptance.
Astronomers often use Mars Sol Date (<abbr>MSD</abbr>) which is a
sequential count of Mars solar days elapsed since about 1873-12-29
12:00 <abbr>GMT</abbr>.
</p>

<p>
In our solar system, Mars is the planet with time and calendar most
like Earth's.
On other planets, Sun-based time and calendars would work quite
differently.
For example, although Mercury's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_period">sidereal
rotation period</a> is 58.646 Earth days, Mercury revolves around the
Sun so rapidly that an observer on Mercury's equator would see a
sunrise only every 175.97 Earth days, i.e., a Mercury year is 0.5 of a
Mercury day.
Venus is more complicated, partly because its rotation is slightly
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion">retrograde</a>:
its year is 1.92 of its days.
Gas giants like Jupiter are trickier still, as their polar and
equatorial regions rotate at different rates, so that the length of a
day depends on latitude.
This effect is most pronounced on Neptune, where the day is about 12
hours at the poles and 18 hours at the equator.
</p>

<p>
Although the <code><abbr>tz</abbr></code> database does not support
time on other planets, it is documented here in the hopes that support
will be added eventually.

# Convert tzdata source into vanguard or rearguard form.

# Contributed by Paul Eggert.  This file is in the public domain.

# This is not a general-purpose converter; it is designed for current tzdata.
# It just converts from current source to main, vanguard, and rearguard forms.
# Although it might be nice for it to be idempotent, or to be useful
# for converting back and forth between vanguard and rearguard formats,
# it does not do these nonessential tasks now.
#
# Although main and vanguard forms are currently equivalent,
# this need not always be the case.  When the two forms differ,
# this script can convert either from main to vanguard form (needed then),
# or from vanguard to main form (this conversion would be needed later,
# after main became rearguard and vanguard became main).
# There is no need to convert rearguard to other forms.
#
# When converting to vanguard form, the output can use the line
# "Zone GMT 0 - GMT" which TZUpdater 2.3.2 mistakenly rejects.
#
# When converting to vanguard form, the output can use negative SAVE
# values.
#
# When converting to rearguard form, the output uses only nonnegative
# SAVE values.  The idea is for the output data to simulate the behavior
# of the input data as best it can within the constraints of the
# rearguard format.

# tzdb timezone descriptions (deprecated version)
#
# This file is in the public domain, so clarified as of
# 2009-05-17 by Arthur David Olson.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2021-09-20):
# This file is intended as a backward-compatibility aid for older programs.
# New programs should use zone1970.tab.  This file is like zone1970.tab (see
# zone1970.tab's comments), but with the following additional restrictions:
#
# 1.  This file contains only ASCII characters.
# 2.  The first data column contains exactly one country code.
#
# Because of (2), each row stands for an area that is the intersection
# of a region identified by a country code and of a timezone where civil
# clocks have agreed since 1970; this is a narrower definition than
# that of zone1970.tab.
#
# Unlike zone1970.tab, a row's third column can be a Link from
# 'backward' instead of a Zone.
#
# This table is intended as an aid for users, to help them select timezones
# appropriate for their practical needs.  It is not intended to take or
# endorse any position on legal or territorial claims.

# tzdb timezone descriptions
#
# This file is in the public domain.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-06-27):
# This file contains a table where each row stands for a timezone where
# civil timestamps have agreed since 1970.  Columns are separated by
# a single tab.  Lines beginning with '#' are comments.  All text uses
# UTF-8 encoding.  The columns of the table are as follows:
#
# 1.  The countries that overlap the timezone, as a comma-separated list
#     of ISO 3166 2-character country codes.  See the file 'iso3166.tab'.
# 2.  Latitude and longitude of the timezone's principal location
#     in ISO 6709 sign-degrees-minutes-seconds format,
#     either ±DDMM±DDDMM or ±DDMMSS±DDDMMSS,
#     first latitude (+ is north), then longitude (+ is east).
# 3.  Timezone name used in value of TZ environment variable.
#     Please see the theory.html file for how these names are chosen.
#     If multiple timezones overlap a country, each has a row in the
#     table, with each column 1 containing the country code.
# 4.  Comments; present if and only if countries have multiple timezones,
#     and useful only for those countries.  For example, the comments
#     for the row with countries CH,DE,LI and name Europe/Zurich
#     are useful only for DE, since CH and LI have no other timezones.
#
# If a timezone covers multiple countries, the most-populous city is used,
# and that country is listed first in column 1; any other countries
# are listed alphabetically by country code.  The table is sorted
# first by country code, then (if possible) by an order within the
# country that (1) makes some geographical sense, and (2) puts the
# most populous timezones first, where that does not contradict (1).
#
# This table is intended as an aid for users, to help them select timezones
# appropriate for their practical needs.  It is not intended to take or
# endorse any position on legal or territorial claims.

# The next section contains experimental tab-separated comments for
# use by user agents like tzselect that identify continents and oceans.
#
# For example, the comment "#@AQ<tab>Antarctica/" means the country code
# AQ is in the continent Antarctica regardless of the Zone name,
# so Pacific/Auckland should be listed under Antarctica as well as
# under the Pacific because its line's country codes include AQ.
#
# If more than one country code is affected each is listed separated
# by commas, e.g., #@IS,SH<tab>Atlantic/".  If a country code is in
# more than one continent or ocean, each is listed separated by
# commas, e.g., the second column of "#@CY,TR<tab>Asia/,Europe/".
#
# These experimental comments are present only for country codes where
# the continent or ocean is not already obvious from the Zone name.
# For example, there is no such comment for RU since it already
# corresponds to Zone names starting with both "Europe/" and "Asia/".
